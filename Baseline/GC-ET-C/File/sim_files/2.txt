<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to implements and implement systems for use in displacing ground material. The implements may include roller apparatus configured to engage a ground surface and form a plurality of reservoirs in the ground surface.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Water distributed through irrigation systems or from rain may be unevenly dispersed over an agricultural field due to runoff and further may be subject to evaporation. For example, a sloped or angled ground surface may also contribute to water runoff where water may run from higher areas of a field to lower areas of the field. Additionally, water exposed on the top of the ground surface may be subject to evaporation.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosure describes exemplary implements, implement systems, and methods for use in conditioning soil. The exemplary implements and implement systems may be configured to be attached to a vehicle such as, e.g., a tractor. The vehicle may traverse a ground surface, such as a field, towing one or more implements in between planted rows of vegetation or crops such as, e.g., corn, soybeans, cotton, wheat, potatoes, sugar beets, sunflowers, and all row crops, etc., or in the preparation of land for construction. An exemplary implement may generally include roller apparatus and an extension member configured to hold, or position, the roller apparatus such that it may engage the ground surface to form a plurality of reservoirs in the ground surface. For example, the extension member may be configured to apply down pressure to the roller apparatus such that the roller apparatus continuously engages the ground surface when in use. The extension member may be pivotably attached to a mount portion, which may be configured to be attached to the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One or more implements may be part of an exemplary system. For example, a plurality of implements, as described herein, may be part of an exemplary implement system. An exemplary system may generally include a frame apparatus (such as, e.g., a beam or other structure) for supporting the plurality of implements and coupling them to the vehicle. Each mount portion of the plurality of implements may be configured to mount or couple each implement to the frame apparatus. In the exemplary system, the plurality of implements may be coupled to the frame apparatus in a spaced apart arrangement along the frame apparatus to facilitate each of the plurality of implements passing between rows of crops.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One exemplary implement couplable to a vehicle configured to traverse a ground surface may include a mount portion couplable to a vehicle, an extension member extending from a proximal end portion to a distal end portion (e.g., wherein the proximal end portion is pivotably coupled to the mount portion about a pivot axis), and a roller apparatus rotatably coupled to the distal end portion of the extension member about a roller axis. For example, the roller apparatus may include a cylindrical portion lying along the roller axis configured to roll over a ground surface (e.g., wherein the cylindrical portion may define an outer surface configured to engage the ground surface when the cylindrical portion is rolled over the ground surface) and a plurality of ground displacing elements coupled to the cylindrical portion and extending from the outer surface of the cylindrical portion (e.g., wherein each ground displacing element of the plurality of ground displacing elements may include a ground lifting surface configured to engage and lift ground material to disperse the ground material and form a plurality of reservoirs in the ground surface when the outer surface is engaged with the ground surface as the cylindrical portion is rolled over the ground surface). The mount portion may be configured to transmit force to the roller apparatus to maintain engagement between the outer surface of the cylindrical portion and the ground surface when the cylindrical portion is rolled over the ground surface.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments, reference is made to the accompanying figures of the drawings which form a part hereof, and in which are shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments which may be practiced. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural changes may be made without departing from (e.g., still falling within) the scope of the disclosure presented hereby.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Exemplary apparatus, systems, and methods shall be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>. It will be apparent to one skilled in the art that elements from one embodiment may be used in combination with elements of the other embodiments, and that the possible embodiments of such apparatus, systems, and methods using combinations of features set forth herein is not limited to the specific embodiments shown in the figures and/or described herein. Further, it will be recognized that the embodiments described herein may include many elements that are not necessarily shown to scale. Still further, it will be recognized that the size and shape of various elements herein may be modified but still fall within the scope of the present disclosure, although certain one or more shapes and/or sizes, or types of elements, may be advantageous over others.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Exemplary implements, implement systems, and methods described herein may be configured to engage a ground surface and till, aerate, and/or form a plurality reservoirs in the ground surface. The exemplary implements may include roller apparatus, and the roller apparatus may include a plurality of ground displacing elements shaped, sized, and/or configured in many different ways which will be described herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>. As used herein, a &#x201c;reservoir&#x201d; may be defined as an indentation, recess, and/or cavity formed within a ground surface configured such that fluid (e.g., water) or material may be collected and/or held therein.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">An exemplary implement <b>510</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>A-<b>1</b>G</figref> may include a mount portion <b>520</b>, an extension member <b>530</b>, and a roller apparatus <b>540</b>. The mount portion <b>520</b> may be configured to be coupled to a vehicle (not shown), such as a tractor, to couple the exemplary implement <b>510</b> to the vehicle. The vehicle may be used to pull the implement between rows of vegetation or crops to form a plurality of reservoirs or to loosen the ground (e.g., aerate, till, etc.) between the rows using the implement <b>510</b>. To provide the coupling between the implement <b>510</b> and a vehicle, the mount portion <b>520</b> may include one or more mounting brackets configured to be coupled, or attached, to a portion of a vehicle. As shown, the mounting brackets may define a plurality of apertures, or openings, through which fasteners, such as bolts, may extend to couple the brackets to the vehicle. Further, other features of the implement <b>510</b> may be included as described in U.S. Pat. No. 9,674,996 entitled &#x201c;Implement for Displacing Ground Material,&#x201d; which is herein incorporated by reference. As such, it is to be understood that one or more such features and/or portions therein may be used interchangeably between each and every embodiment described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The mount portion <b>520</b> may not be directly coupled to a vehicle, and instead, may be coupled to apparatus that is coupled to the vehicle. For example, the mount portion <b>520</b> may be coupled to frame apparatus, such as, e.g., a beam, or other support member, which may be coupled to the vehicle. In one or more embodiments, exemplary frame apparatus may be raised or lowered by the vehicle so as to raise or lower the implement <b>510</b> to engage a ground surface. For example, the mount portion <b>520</b> may be couplable to and/or coupled to a frame apparatus that extends transverse to the forward moving direction of a vehicle and the frame apparatus may be coupled to a hydraulic system of the vehicle to raise and lower the implement <b>510</b> when used in conjunction with the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The mount portion <b>520</b> may be configured to transmit force to the roller apparatus <b>540</b> from the vehicle to maintain engagement between the roller apparatus <b>540</b> and a ground surface when the roller apparatus <b>540</b> is rolled over the ground surface. For example, the vehicle may provide a force, or may allow the mass of the implement <b>510</b> itself to provide a force, to direct the roller apparatus <b>540</b> in engagement with the ground surface when in use, and the mount portion <b>520</b> may facilitate, or transmit, that force to the roller apparatus <b>540</b>. Additionally, the mount portion <b>520</b> may be configured to transmit force to the roller apparatus <b>540</b> by being biased in a clockwise direction about a pivot axis. Other methods of transmitting force to the roller apparatus <b>540</b> may be used such as, e.g., airbags, a bellows suspension system, the weight of substance (e.g., fertilizer) tanks positioned thereon, a torsional spring system, a linear spring actuator system, a rotary or linear hydraulic actuator/accumulator system, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The extension member <b>530</b> may extend from a proximal end portion <b>532</b> to a distal end portion <b>534</b> and may be pivotally coupled to the mount portion about the pivot axis. As used herein, &#x201c;pivotally coupled&#x201d; may be defined as a coupling between objects such that the objects are configured for pivotal movement in relation to each other. As depicted, the mount portion <b>520</b> may be pivotally coupled to the proximal end portion <b>532</b> of the extension member <b>530</b> through the use of an elongate torsion assembly <b>580</b> (see, e.g., a &#x201c;Henschen&#x201d; suspension as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,436,069 entitled &#x201c;Bearing Assembly for Elastic Joints&#x201d; and issued to Henschen on Apr. 1, 1969 and U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2007/0024016 A1 entitled &#x201c;Parallel Torsion Suspension Assembly&#x201d; published on Feb. 1, 2007, each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In other embodiments, the mount portion may be pivotally coupled to the proximal end portion of the extension member through the use of, for example, a spring, a strut, a shock absorber, a linear spring/damper system, a rotary or linear hydraulic actuator/accumulator system or any suitable suspension element or system or combination of such elements or systems, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The extension member <b>530</b> may be made, or formed of, metal such as steel, aluminum, cast iron, plastic (e.g., for example, fiber-reinforced or glass-filled) or any other suitable material. Further, the extension member <b>530</b> may be formed by cutting (e.g., laser cutting, stamping, blanking, water-jet cutting, or plasma cutting, etc.) a sheet of material and then bending, or forming, the sheet of material into the desired shape. Additionally, the extension member <b>530</b> may be formed using any suitable method including casting, forging or injection molding. As shown, one or more cutouts may be defined, or formed, in the extension member <b>530</b> to, e.g., reduce weight, provide access points for serviceability, provide debris cleanout and/or flow-through for debris, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The distal end portion <b>534</b> of the extension member may extend towards the ground surface and may be coupled to the roller apparatus <b>540</b> to locate the roller apparatus <b>540</b> proximate the ground surface such that the roller apparatus <b>540</b> may engage and contact the ground (e.g., for example, continuously, to ensure that the roller apparatus <b>540</b> outer surface <b>543</b> of the cylindrical portion <b>541</b> maintains contact with the ground surface and does not bounce off the ground surface, or intermittently, so that the roller apparatus <b>540</b> or the outer surface <b>543</b> of the cylindrical portion <b>541</b> maintains contact with the ground surface at least a portion of the time) when in use.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The roller apparatus <b>540</b> may be configured to engage and lift ground material to disperse the ground material and/or form a plurality of reservoirs in the ground surface as the implement <b>510</b> traverses the ground surface. As the roller apparatus <b>540</b> traverses the ground surface, the roller apparatus <b>540</b> may roll over the ground surface. To facilitate the rotational motion of the roller apparatus <b>540</b>, the roller apparatus <b>540</b> may be rotatably coupled to the distal end portion <b>534</b> of the extension member <b>530</b> about a roller axis <b>16</b>. As used herein, &#x201c;rotatably coupled&#x201d; may be defined as a coupling between objects such that the objects are rotatable in relation to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The roller apparatus <b>540</b> may include a cylindrical portion <b>541</b> defining an outer surface <b>543</b> and a plurality of ground displacing elements <b>560</b> (e.g., soil displacing elements). The cylindrical portion <b>541</b> may extend from a first end portion to a second end portion defining a roller width. The roller width (e.g., for example, a roller width sized to be positioned between crop rows) may be about 8 inches to about 42 inches, such as, e.g., about 8 inches, about 12 inches, about 21 inches, about 22 inches, about 24 inches, about 42 inches, or any size in between those described herein, but not limited thereto, etc., and may be dependent on the distance between crop rows for which the implement is intended to be used. Each of the first end portion and the second end portion may be rotatably coupled to the extension member <b>530</b> about the roller axis <b>16</b> such that the roller apparatus <b>540</b> is rotatably coupled to the extension member <b>530</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The plurality of ground displacing elements <b>560</b> may be coupled to the cylindrical portion <b>541</b> and extend outwardly from the outer surface <b>543</b> of the cylindrical portion <b>541</b>. The plurality of ground displacing elements <b>560</b> may be configured to extend into the ground, or beyond the ground surface, to engage and lift ground material when the outer surface <b>543</b> of the cylindrical portion <b>541</b> is engaged with the ground surface as the roller apparatus <b>540</b> and portions thereof such as the cylindrical portion <b>541</b> are rolled over the ground surface. After the ground material is lifted by the ground displacing elements <b>560</b>, the ground displacing elements <b>560</b> may disperse the ground material. In one or more embodiments, the ground material may be dispersed to the sides of the roller apparatus <b>540</b>, e.g., direction traverse to the forward moving motion of the vehicle. Further, the ground displacing elements <b>560</b> may be described as being configured to dig, remove, separate, break apart, rip, and/or lift the ground material out of the ground, and subsequently, disperse the ground material.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As noted, the outer surface <b>543</b> of the cylindrical portion <b>541</b> may be configured to engage the ground surface when the cylindrical portion <b>541</b> is rolled over the ground surface. As used herein, &#x201c;engage a ground surface&#x201d; may be defined as touching, or contacting, the ground surface while the object is in use. For example, when the outer surface <b>543</b> of the cylindrical portion <b>541</b> of the roller apparatus <b>540</b> engages the ground surface, at least a portion of the outer surface <b>543</b> may touch, or be in contact, with the ground surface at least a portion of the time when in use. Further, in one embodiment, the exemplary implement <b>510</b> may be configured such that the outer surface <b>543</b> of the cylindrical portion <b>541</b> engages, or contacts, the ground continuously or intermittently when in use (e.g., the suspension apparatus coupling the mount portion <b>520</b> to the extension member <b>530</b> may transmit force to the roller apparatus <b>540</b> to provide continuous or intermittent engagement between the outer surface <b>543</b> of the cylindrical portion <b>541</b> and the ground surface).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>A</figref>, the roller apparatus <b>540</b> may include cylindrical portion <b>541</b>, which defines an outer cylindrical surface <b>543</b>. The plurality of ground displacing elements <b>560</b> may be removably coupled to the cylindrical portion <b>541</b> (e.g., adjacent to the outer cylindrical surface <b>543</b>, in contact with the outer cylindrical surface <b>543</b>, etc.). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref>, the plurality of ground displacing elements <b>560</b> may be arranged in a plurality of rows (each row being noted as being between a pair of the dotted lines <b>555</b>) that circumferentially extend around the outer cylindrical surface <b>543</b>. In this embodiment, the plurality of ground displacing elements <b>560</b> may be arranged, or grouped, in three rows. In other embodiments, the plurality of ground displacing elements <b>560</b> may be arranged, or grouped, in more than three rows such as, e.g., four rows, six rows, etc. or less than three rows such as, e.g., two rows and one row. Additionally, in this embodiment, the plurality of ground displacing elements <b>560</b> may be described as being in a staggered configuration or arrangement. For example, the plurality of ground displacing elements <b>560</b> of the left-most row in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> may not be coupled to the cylindrical portion <b>541</b> at the same point about the circumference of the cylindrical portion <b>541</b> as the plurality of ground displacing elements <b>560</b> of the other rows such as the middle row or right-most row. In other words, it may be described that the plurality of ground displacing elements <b>560</b> are staggered with respect to each other such that each of the plurality of ground displacing elements <b>560</b> do not extend from the same location, or point, about the circumference of the cylindrical portion as any other of ground displacing elements <b>560</b> (e.g., located in other rows). Further, although is this embodiment, all of the plurality of ground displacing elements <b>560</b> are staggered with respect to each other, it is to be understood that, in some embodiments, two or more rows of ground displacing elements <b>560</b> may be aligned with each other (e.g. located at the same point, or location, about the circumference of the cylindrical portion <b>541</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Each of the ground displacing elements <b>560</b> may include a blade portion <b>562</b> and an attachment portion <b>564</b> coupled (e.g., fixedly coupled, integral to, etc.) to the blade portion <b>562</b>. The attachment portion <b>564</b> may be removably coupled to the cylindrical portion <b>541</b>. More specifically, the attachment portion <b>564</b> may be removably coupled to the cylindrical portion <b>541</b> such that the attachment portion <b>564</b> is adjacent, or in contact with, at least a region or section of the outer cylindrical surface <b>543</b> of the cylindrical portion <b>541</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">To provide the removable coupling between the attachment portion <b>564</b> and the cylindrical portion <b>541</b>, the attachment portion <b>564</b> may define an opening <b>567</b> configured to receive a fastener <b>565</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>D</figref> which shows one ground displacing element <b>560</b> un-coupled from the cylindrical portion <b>541</b>. The fastener <b>565</b> may be configured to be used, or in conjunction, with a keyhole-shaped opening <b>594</b> that extends through the outer cylindrical surface <b>543</b> of the cylindrical portion <b>541</b>. Further, the cylindrical portion <b>541</b> may further define a secondary opening <b>592</b> for each of the ground displacing elements <b>560</b>. Thus, the cylindrical portion <b>541</b> may define a plurality of secondary openings <b>592</b> (e.g., any shaped openings, or combination of openings, including holes, slots, or any other suitable openings) and a plurality of keyhole-shaped openings <b>594</b> (e.g., shaped openings providing the functionality described herein including a larger opening region adjacent a smaller opening region; such opening regions having any suitable shape). One secondary opening <b>592</b> and one keyhole-shaped opening <b>594</b> paired together may provide the coupling of a ground displacing element <b>560</b> to the cylindrical portion <b>541</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">More specifically, each fastener <b>565</b> may be configured to extend through the opening <b>567</b> of the attachment portion <b>564</b> of the ground displacing element <b>560</b>. During attachment, the fastener <b>565</b> may be first located in a larger region <b>597</b> of the keyhole-shaped opening <b>594</b> such that a portion of the fastener <b>565</b> (e.g., the head of a bolt) may be placed through the larger region <b>597</b> and then the ground displacing element <b>560</b> may be moved such that the fastener <b>565</b> may be located in a slot region <b>598</b> of the keyhole-shaped opening <b>594</b>. When the fastener <b>565</b> is located in the slot region <b>598</b>, a retention portion <b>569</b> of the attachment portion <b>564</b> of the ground displacing element <b>560</b> may align, or &#x201c;line up,&#x201d; with and be received by the secondary opening <b>592</b> to, e.g., assist in retaining the ground displacing element <b>560</b> coupled to the cylindrical portion <b>541</b>. Additionally, the attachment portion <b>564</b> may further include an additional retention portion <b>571</b> configured to be located in the keyhole-shaped opening <b>594</b> (e.g., the larger region <b>597</b> of the keyhole-shaped opening <b>594</b>). In other words, the attachment portion <b>564</b> of the ground displacing element <b>560</b> may include a first retention portion <b>569</b> configured to be located in the secondary opening <b>592</b> and a second retention portion <b>571</b> configured to be located in the larger region <b>597</b> of the keyhole-shaped opening <b>594</b> to restrict, or retain, the ground displacing element <b>560</b> to the cylindrical portion <b>541</b>. Once the first and second retention portions <b>569</b>, <b>571</b> are located in the secondary opening <b>592</b> and the larger region <b>597</b> of the keyhole-shaped openings <b>594</b> and the fastener <b>565</b> extends through the opening <b>567</b> and a portion of the fastener <b>565</b> is located in the slot region <b>598</b> of the keyhole-shaped opening <b>594</b>, a nut <b>563</b>, or other restriction device, may be coupled to the fastener <b>565</b> to couple the attachment portion <b>564</b> to the outer cylindrical surface <b>543</b> of the cylindrical portion <b>541</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In other words, the fastener <b>565</b> may be located in the opening <b>567</b> of the attachment portion <b>564</b> of the ground displacing element <b>560</b> and the ground displacing element <b>560</b> may be located, or positioned, such that a portion of the fastener <b>565</b> such as a &#x201c;head&#x201d; of a bolt extends through the larger region <b>597</b> of the keyhole-shaped opening <b>594</b> (e.g., extends through the outer cylindrical surface <b>543</b> of the cylindrical portion <b>541</b>). Then, the ground displacing element <b>560</b> may be moved to slide the fastener <b>565</b> towards the slot region <b>598</b> of the keyhole-shaped opening <b>594</b> such that the portion of the fastener <b>565</b> is restricted from passing back through the keyhole-shaped opening <b>594</b> (e.g., due to the size of the slot region <b>598</b> being smaller than the larger region <b>597</b>). Or, the fastener <b>565</b> may be located in the larger region <b>597</b> and slid into the slot region <b>594</b> prior to the ground displacing element <b>560</b> being positioned such that the fastener is located in the opening <b>567</b> and proximate the cylindrical portion <b>541</b>. Additionally, the ground displacing element <b>560</b> may be moved to align the first and second retention portions <b>569</b>, <b>571</b> with the secondary opening <b>592</b> and the larger region <b>597</b> of the keyhole-shape opening <b>594</b> such that the first and second retention portions <b>569</b>, <b>571</b> may be received by the secondary opening <b>592</b> and the larger region <b>597</b> of the keyhole-shape opening <b>594</b>, respectively. Then, a restriction device <b>563</b> such as a nut may be secured, or coupled, to the fastener <b>565</b> to complete the coupling of the attachment portion <b>564</b>, and thus, the ground displacing element <b>560</b>, to the cylindrical portion <b>541</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Further, in one or more embodiments, the blade portion <b>562</b> of the ground displacing elements <b>560</b> defines, or includes, a ground lifting surface <b>568</b> that may be described as being bent, or angled, so as to define a first portion <b>590</b> and a second portion <b>593</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>E</figref>. The first portion <b>590</b> and the second portion <b>593</b> may lie, or extend within, different planes than each other so as to be described as being non-planar, or not lying substantially in a single plane. For example, the first portion <b>590</b> may lie in a first plane and the second portion <b>593</b> may lie in a second plane, and the first plane may be different, or intersect with, the second plane defining an angle. The angle between the first portion <b>590</b> and the second portion <b>593</b> may be between about 185 degrees to about 300 degrees. For example, the angle may be greater than or equal to about 185 degrees, greater than or equal to about 200 degrees, greater than or equal to about 210 degrees, greater than or equal to about 220 degrees, greater than or equal to about 230 degrees, greater than or equal to about 240 degrees or more, greater than or equal to about 250 degrees or more, greater than or equal to about 260 degrees or more, greater than or equal to about 270 degrees or more, greater than or equal to about 280 degrees or more, etc. Further, for example, the angle may be less than or equal to about 330 degrees, less than or equal to about 310 degrees, less than or equal to about 300 degrees, less than or equal to about 285 degrees, less than or equal to about 275 degrees, less than or equal to about 265 degrees, less than or equal to about 255 degrees, less than or equal to about 245 degrees, less than or equal to about 225 degrees, or less than or equal to about 200 degrees, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The first portion <b>590</b> and the second portion <b>593</b> may be described as intersecting at an apex <b>588</b>. Further, the first portion <b>590</b> and the second portion <b>593</b> may be described as providing, or defining, a chisel edge <b>587</b> extending along at least a portion of the blade portion <b>562</b>. In other words, the apex <b>588</b> may define the point, or edge, of the chisel edge <b>587</b> of the blade portion <b>562</b>. The chisel edge <b>587</b> may be described as an edge of a blade or knife configured to cut into the ground surface. The chisel edge <b>587</b> may engage the ground surface prior to the remainder of the ground displacing element <b>560</b> when the roller apparatus <b>540</b> is engaged with the ground surface as the vehicle traverses the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>F</figref>, the chisel edge <b>587</b> extend around the perimeter, or at least a portion (e.g., the majority) of the perimeter of the blade portion <b>562</b>. More specifically, the chisel edge <b>587</b> may be described as being included or defined on the forward or leading edge <b>601</b> of the blade portion <b>562</b> and the rear or trailing edge <b>602</b>. The forward edge <b>601</b> may be further described as being opposite the rearward edge <b>602</b> as, e.g., the forward edge <b>601</b> may face the direction of rotation while the rearward edge <b>602</b> may face opposite the direction of rotation of the cylindrical portion. The chisel edge <b>587</b> may be described as extending entirely around the blade portion <b>562</b> except for an attachment region <b>605</b> where the blade portion <b>562</b> is attached, or fixed, to the attachment portion <b>564</b>. Further, the chisel edge <b>587</b> may be described as the first portion or region of the blade portion <b>562</b> to enter or contact the ground surface when being used to engage and disperse ground material. Additionally, each of the forward and rearward edges <b>601</b> and <b>602</b> may meet, or intersect, at a point, or tip, <b>603</b> of the blade portion <b>562</b>. In this embodiment, the rearward edge <b>602</b> is curved or defines a curve. In other embodiments, the rearward edge <b>602</b> may not be curved, and instead, extend along a linearly line or a mixture of linear and curved. For example, a majority of the rearward edge <b>602</b> may be curved while a minority is linear. The curvature of the rearward edge <b>602</b> may assist the entering, or engaging, of the ground displacing element <b>560</b> into the ground surface. Further, the majority of the forward edge <b>601</b> extends linearly (e.g., non-curved) to the point <b>603</b>. In other embodiments, the forward edge <b>601</b> may not be straight, and instead, be at least partially curved.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Further, as shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>G</figref>, the blade portions <b>562</b> of the ground displacing elements <b>560</b> may be described as being tilted or rotated <b>611</b> about an axis <b>610</b> with respect to the forward moving direction of the implement <b>510</b>. The axis <b>610</b> may extend from the cylindrical portion radially (e.g., perpendicularly to a tangent of the circumference of the cylindrical portion) and the blade portions <b>562</b> may be described as being rotated, or angled, <b>611</b> about the axis <b>610</b> with the forward moving direction being zero degrees. In other words, the blade portions <b>562</b> may extend out of a plane lying parallel to the forward moving or rolling direction of the implement <b>510</b>. For example, a plane parallel to the moving or rolling direction of the implement <b>510</b> is represented by dashed line <b>512</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>B</figref> proximate one of the ground displacing elements <b>560</b>. As shown, the blade portion <b>562</b> does not substantially lie within the plane represent by dashed line <b>512</b> and is, instead, tilted or rotated with respect to the plane. The tilt, or rotation, <b>611</b> of the blade portions <b>562</b> may assist the blade portions <b>562</b> to extend through the ground surface <b>12</b> to engage the ground material (e.g., dig, lift, rip, etc. the ground material). Further, as shown, the plurality of ground displacing elements <b>560</b> may include blade portions <b>562</b> tilted, or rotated, in different (e.g., opposite) directions.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In other words, the blade portions <b>562</b> may each being described as lying, or extending, in a plane, and the plane may not be perpendicular (or parallel) to the rolling axis of the cylindrical portion <b>541</b>. For example, the plane within which the blade portion lies may be considered to be twisted, or angled, from the radial axis, or line, <b>610</b>, which is perpendicular to the rolling axis of the cylindrical portion <b>541</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The blade portions <b>562</b> of the ground displacing elements <b>560</b> may be described as being tilted or rotated <b>611</b> about the axis <b>610</b> from the forward moving direction between about 0 and about 45 degrees. In one or more embodiments, the blade portions <b>562</b> of the ground displacing elements <b>560</b> may be described as being tilted or rotated <b>611</b> about the axis <b>610</b> from the forward moving direction greater than or equal to about 2 degrees, greater than or equal to about 4 degrees, greater than or equal to about 5 degrees, greater than or equal to about 8 degrees, greater than or equal to about 10 degrees, greater than or equal to about 12 degrees, greater than or equal to about 14 degrees, greater than or equal to about 16 degrees, greater than or equal to about 20 degrees, greater than or equal to about 25 degrees, greater than or equal to about 30 degrees, greater than or equal to about 35 degrees, etc. Further, in one or more embodiments, the blade portions <b>562</b> of the ground displacing elements <b>560</b> may be described as being tilted or rotated <b>611</b> about the axis <b>610</b> from the forward moving direction less than or equal to about 45 degrees, less than or equal to about 40 degrees, less than or equal to about 38 degrees, less than or equal to about 34 degrees, less than or equal to about 32 degrees, less than or equal to about 27 degrees, less than or equal to about 23 degrees, less than or equal to about 18 degrees, less than or equal to about 13 degrees, less than or equal to about 11 degrees, less than or equal to about 9 degrees, less than or equal to about 7 degrees, less than or equal to about 3 degrees, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Additionally, the ground lifting surface <b>568</b> of the blade portion <b>562</b> may be described as extending at non-radial angle. For example, substantially all or a majority of the ground lifting surface <b>568</b> may not extend along a radial line (e.g., a line that extends through the rolling axis <b>16</b> of the cylindrical portion <b>541</b>). In other words, substantially all or a majority of the ground lifting surface <b>568</b> may extend along a dashed line <b>581</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b>C</figref> that does not extend through the rolling axis <b>16</b> of the cylindrical portion <b>541</b>. Further, in other words, substantially all or a majority of the ground lifting surface <b>568</b> may extend along a dashed line <b>581</b> that does not form a right angle with a tangential line (i.e., a line tangential to outer cylindrical surface <b>543</b>) where the dashed line <b>581</b> enters the outer cylindrical surface <b>543</b>. Still further, the ground lifting surface <b>568</b> may be described as being forward slanted or angled towards the rolling direction of the cylindrical portion <b>541</b>. More specifically, substantially all or a majority of the ground lifting surface <b>568</b> may extend along a dashed line <b>581</b> that forms an acute angle with a tangential line (i.e., a line tangential to outer cylindrical surface <b>543</b>) where the dashed line <b>581</b> enters the outer cylindrical surface <b>543</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Furthermore, in one or more embodiments, the implement apparatus <b>510</b> may also include additional components to assist in tilling the rows of crops. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, the implement apparatus <b>510</b> may include a cleaner apparatus <b>110</b> extending forward along a longitudinal axis <b>101</b> (e.g., extending between the proximal end portion <b>532</b> and the distal end portion <b>534</b> of the extension member <b>530</b>) from the roller apparatus <b>540</b>. Specifically, the cleaner apparatus <b>110</b> may be located proximate the proximal end portion <b>532</b> of the extension member <b>530</b>. The cleaner apparatus <b>110</b> may include one or more cleaners positioned to lead the implement apparatus <b>510</b> through various debris and residue on the ground surface. The cleaners may be configured to extend at least partially under the ground surface to assist in diverting debris and residue.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The one or more cleaners may define any suitable shape and size. For example, in one or more embodiments, the cleaners may define a circular shape and may be configured to rotate relative to the ground surface (e.g., to reduce resistance with the ground surface, to assist in moving debris and residue). Specifically, the one or more cleaners may include a thin disc defining a thickness of about 0.25 inches to about 0.5 inches (e.g., specifically about 0.375 inches). In one or more embodiments, the one or more cleaners may be described as a plate or sheet and define any suitable geometry (e.g., square, triangle, rectangle, circle, etc.). Further, in one or more embodiments, the cleaners may include teeth defining a circumferential profile of the cleaner. The teeth may assist in grabbing the debris and residue and moving it towards the sides of the implement <b>510</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, the cleaner apparatus may include a pair of cleaners <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> configured to rotate relative to the ground surface. Further, the pair of cleaners <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> may be oriented such that the cleaners <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> angle towards one another at a forwardmost point of the pair of cleaners <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>. In one or more embodiments, the cleaner apparatus <b>110</b> may only include a single cleaner (e.g., taking the shape of one cleaner as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> or a single unitary piece shaped similar to the pair of cleaners)</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The pair of cleaners <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> may be adapted to clear the path from debris and residue from the path of the roller apparatus <b>540</b>. For example, debris and residue (e.g., downed corn stalks) may have fallen between rows of crops that could clog the roller apparatus <b>540</b> if left in the path. Therefore, the cleaners <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> may be angled to towards a point facing forward such that the debris and residue may deflect off the side of the cleaners <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> (e.g., to avoid the roller apparatus). Specifically, the cleaners <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> may be angled relative to one another at an angle of about 15 to 45 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The cleaner apparatus <b>110</b> may also include a bracket <b>114</b> (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>B</figref>) pivotably coupled to the extension member <b>530</b> and fixedly coupled to the pair of cleaners <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> such that the pair of cleaners <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> may pivot relative to the extension member <b>530</b>. In other words, the angle and distance between the cleaners <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> may be fixed based on the structure of the bracket <b>114</b>. Also, the cleaners <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> may pivot in unison due to being fixedly attached to the bracket <b>114</b>. For example, if the cleaners <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> pass over a bump or rock, the cleaners <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> may pivot upward to prevent damage that may result from an inflexible pair of cleaners <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>. Further, in one or more embodiments, the cleaner apparatus <b>110</b> may also include a spring <b>120</b> and a chain <b>122</b> (e.g., a log chain) attached between the extension member <b>530</b> and the pair of cleaners <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>. The spring <b>120</b> and the chain <b>122</b> may set the drop distance (or float) of the cleaners <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> relative to the ground surface and may provide some cushioning to any jarring resulting from undulations of the terrain (e.g., over which the implement <b>510</b> is traveling). Specifically, the cleaners <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> may be positioned such that an edge of the disc (e.g., the teeth) is just below the ground surface and, e.g., the chain <b>122</b> may help control that elevation.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It is noted that, in one or more embodiments, the cleaner apparatus <b>110</b> may only include a chain <b>122</b> (e.g., not including a spring <b>120</b>) attached between the extension member <b>530</b> and the bracket <b>114</b> (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref>). Specifically, the chain <b>122</b> (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>A</figref>) may be coupled to the extension member <b>530</b> and a front portion of the bracket <b>114</b>. Therefore, the chain <b>122</b> may support each of the cleaners <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> through the bracket <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The implement <b>510</b> may also include a hipper apparatus <b>130</b> extending rearward along the longitudinal axis <b>101</b> from the roller apparatus <b>540</b>. The hipper apparatus may include a first hipper <b>131</b> and a second hipper <b>132</b>. The first and second hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> may be oriented such that the hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> angle towards one another at a rearwardmost point of the first and second hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b>. Specifically, the hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> may be angled relative to one another at an angle of about 15 to 45 degrees. The hippers may include a thin disc defining a thickness of about 0.25 inches to about 0.5 inches (e.g., specifically about 0.375 inches). In one or more embodiments, the hippers may be described as a plate or sheet and define any suitable geometry (e.g., square, triangle, rectangle, circle, etc.). Also, each of the hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> may include teeth defining a circumferential profile of the hipper <b>131</b>, <b>132</b>. It is noted that while the hipper apparatus <b>130</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref> includes two hippers, any suitable number of hippers (e.g., including one) may be contemplated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The hipper apparatus <b>130</b> may act as a closer to guide the soil or dirt back into the center of the path of the implement <b>510</b>. For example, after the roller apparatus <b>540</b> travels over the ground surface, the dirt or soil that is loosened and kicked up may move away from the center of the path of the implement <b>510</b>. Therefore, the hipper apparatus <b>130</b> may pull that soil or dirt back to the middle and form mounds that may settle over time.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The hipper apparatus <b>130</b> may include an arm <b>134</b> for each of the first and second hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> to extend the hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> backwards and away from the roller apparatus <b>540</b>. The arms <b>134</b> may be coupled between the extension member <b>530</b> and the corresponding hipper <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> such that each hipper <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> may be adapted to pivot independently relative to the extension member <b>530</b>. In one or more embodiments, the hipper apparatus <b>130</b> may also include a stopper adapted to limit the pivotal movement of the arm <b>134</b> relative to the extension member <b>530</b>. For example, the hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> may pivot independently such that if one or both of the hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> encounter a rock or bump, the affected hipper may deflect upwards as needed. Further, the stopper may prevent the hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> from pivoting downward further than desired by the user. The stopper may be adjustable to control the angle and position of the arms <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Furthermore, the arms <b>134</b> for each of the first and second hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> may have an adjustable length along the longitudinal axis <b>101</b>. In other words, the distance that the hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> extend rearward from the extension member <b>530</b> may be adjustable as desired. For example, in one or more embodiments, the first and second hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> may be positioned at the same distance from the extension member <b>530</b> along the longitudinal axis <b>101</b>. In other embodiments, the first and second hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> may be positioned to be staggered relative to the extension member <b>530</b> along the longitudinal axis <b>101</b> (e.g., the first and second hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> may be positioned at different distances from the extension member <b>530</b>). Therefore, if the gap between the hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> is too small to allow some debris to pass through the gap, the length of the hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> may be adjusted such that the hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> are offset along the longitudinal axis <b>101</b>. Further, in one or more embodiments, the arms <b>134</b> may be completely detachable (e.g., if designed to have two telescoping portions for adjustability) such that the implement <b>510</b> may be operated without the presence of the hipper apparatus <b>130</b> or having only a single hipper.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In one or more embodiments, the hipper apparatus <b>130</b> may include a vertical support <b>136</b> coupled between each of the first and second hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> and the corresponding arm <b>134</b>. The vertical support <b>136</b> may be movably coupled to the arm <b>134</b> such that the first and second hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> may be adapted to be vertically adjusted relative to the extension member <b>530</b>. For example, the hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b> may be adjust based on the height of the roller apparatus <b>540</b> and the distance between the ground surface and the hippers <b>131</b>, <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In another embodiment of the implement apparatus <b>510</b>, the hipper apparatus <b>130</b> may include one or more finger elements <b>139</b> or teeth that extend downward, e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>A-<b>4</b>C</figref>. For example, the one or more finger elements <b>139</b> may extend into the ground surface during operation to help disperse and level the ground after the tilling and displacing via the ground displacement element <b>560</b>. For example, in one or more embodiments, the hipper apparatus <b>130</b> may include arms <b>134</b> coupled to and extending from the extension member <b>530</b> to a position rearward of the extension member <b>530</b>. Also, a crossmember <b>138</b> may extend between the arms <b>134</b> and the one or more finger elements <b>139</b> may be operatively coupled to the crossmember <b>138</b>. Therefore, the one or more finger elements <b>139</b> may be span a width of the implement apparatus <b>510</b> and disperse the ground along that width.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The one or more finger elements <b>139</b> may include any suitable number of finger elements <b>139</b> and may be spaced apart in any suitable way. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the hipper apparatus <b>130</b> may include four finger elements evenly spaced apart along the crossmember <b>138</b>. Additionally, the one or more finger elements <b>139</b> may define any suitable length. For example, the one or more finger elements <b>139</b> may define a length such that a distal end of the finger elements extend into the ground surface when the implement apparatus <b>510</b> is in use (e.g., such that the distal end is below the outer cylindrical surface <b>543</b> of the cylindrical portion <b>541</b>). In one or more embodiments, the arm <b>134</b> may be adjusted (e.g., vertically or pivotally) to set the position of the finger elements <b>139</b> (e.g., to ensure the distal end is in the ground surface).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The one or more finger elements <b>139</b> may include (e.g., be formed of) any suitable material. For example, the one or more finger elements <b>139</b> may include a wire that may or may not deform, but maintains shape. Further, the one or more finger elements <b>139</b> may be coupled to the crossmember <b>138</b> in any suitable way. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>B</figref>, the one or more finger elements <b>139</b> may wrap around the crossmember <b>138</b> to couple thereto. As such, the one or more finger elements <b>139</b> may pivot relative to the crossmember <b>138</b> or deflect as the one or more finger elements traverses the ground surface. In other words, the one or more finger elements <b>139</b> may define a robustness to engage and disperse portions of the ground surface, but flexible enough to deflect over undulations or rocks.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As such, different combinations of the cleaner apparatus <b>110</b>, the roller apparatus <b>540</b>, and the hipper apparatus <b>130</b> may be used for various different applications. For example, in the Fall, the implement apparatus <b>510</b> may be set up to include all three of the cleaner apparatus <b>110</b>, the roller apparatus <b>540</b>, and the hipper apparatus <b>130</b> for strip tilling between crop rows (e.g., to set things up for the Spring). Then, in the Spring, the implement <b>510</b> may include the cleaner apparatus <b>110</b> and the roller apparatus <b>540</b> to aerate and freshen the soil (or, e.g., deposit fertilizer). After the crop is up, the implement <b>510</b> may be used once again to aerate the ground surface and form reservoirs in the ground surface to collect water. Additionally, in an implement configuration that only includes the cleaner apparatus <b>110</b> and the roller apparatus <b>540</b>, the cleaner apparatus <b>110</b> may push fertilizer or nitrogen into the crops (e.g., because the hipper apparatus <b>130</b> is not present to pull the fertilizer back towards the center).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>A-<b>3</b>C</figref>, the implement <b>510</b> may also include a housing <b>140</b> at least partially surrounding the roller apparatus <b>540</b>. The housing <b>140</b> may include side plates <b>142</b> positioned on either side of the roller apparatus <b>540</b>, a top plate <b>144</b> positioned above the roller apparatus <b>540</b>, and a rear plate <b>146</b> (also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>C</figref>) positioned rearward of the roller apparatus <b>540</b>. The housing <b>140</b> may assist in containing dirt or soil that might otherwise be thrown to the side by the roller apparatus <b>540</b>. For example, dirt or soil that is kicked-up by the roller apparatus <b>540</b> may enter the housing <b>140</b> and land generally within the path of the implement <b>510</b>. Also, in one or more embodiments, the rear plate <b>146</b> may be pivotally coupled to the top plate <b>144</b> and/or the side plates <b>142</b> such that the rear plate <b>146</b> may pivot at the top end for servicing the roller apparatus <b>540</b> or cleaning out debris that may get caught in the housing <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In any of the embodiments discussed herein, one or more ground breaking apparatus (e.g., sweep blades, row crop sweeps, chisel elements, or sweep cultivators) may be coupled to any of the implements or systems described herein. The one or more ground breaking apparatus may be configured to break up or loosen the ground material prior to the roller apparatus forming reservoirs in the ground surface (e.g., mounted ahead of the roller apparatus in the direction of travel).</p>
