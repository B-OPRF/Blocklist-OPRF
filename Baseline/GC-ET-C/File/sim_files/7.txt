<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a device for planting seeds. More specifically, the present invention relates to a device for closing a seed groove after a seed is placed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of the Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A furrow closing assembly is used in connection with and drawn behind a planter row unit, which is typically towed behind a tractor. The planter row unit opens a furrow in the ground and places seed in the furrow. The closing assembly closes the furrow after placement of the seed. A typical furrow closing assembly, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, includes blades <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>for the purpose of closing the seed groove or furrow after the seed has been placed. A typical closing assembly also includes a press wheel <b>32</b> for the purpose of applying pressure to the soil surface after the furrow is closed to improve seed to soil contact. The press wheel <b>32</b> moves independently of the blades <b>30</b>. The independent motion of the press wheel compresses the soil through the application of a consistent force. The independent contact of the press wheel with the ground relative to the closing wheels provides consistent contact between the press wheel and the ground, but results in a rougher ride of the press wheel over the surface and creates a significant amount of chatter when the press wheel passes over the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Accordingly, there is a need for a device that closes a seed groove without compacting the soil unnecessarily thereby improving crop yield. There is also a need for a device that provides for smoother and more consistent contact between the press wheel and the soil surface.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is thereby intended. The invention includes any alterations and further modifications in the illustrated devices and described methods and further applications of the principles of the invention that would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">One presently preferred embodiment of the invention comprises a furrow closing unit having at least one coulter blade to close a seed groove after the seed is deposited inside the seed groove/opening/furrow and a rolling basket trailing the at least one coulter blade to press the soil. The rolling basket facilitates a gentler compression of the soil than the press wheel of the prior art leaving the soil smoother and less compact which promotes growth. Further, the rolling basket is fixedly attached to the frame to which at least one coulter is fixedly attached. Accordingly, the closing unit prevents any independent movement of the rolling basket relative to the at least one coulter blade, enabling a smoother, more consistent ride for the closing unit as a whole.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a furrow closing unit <b>100</b> suitable for closing seed groove/opening/furrow defined in a soil and compacting the soil is shown. The closing unit <b>100</b> is adapted to pivotally attach to a planting unit <b>300</b> towed behind an agricultural machine, such as, a tractor. Although the tractor is contemplated as the agricultural machine, it may be envisioned that any other agricultural machine suitable for performing operation at an agricultural field can also be utilized. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, the closing unit <b>100</b> includes a frame <b>102</b> having a first end <b>104</b> (i.e., a front end <b>104</b>) and a second end <b>106</b> (i.e., a rear end <b>106</b>) and two longitudinal sides <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> arranged spaced part and extending from the front end <b>104</b> to the rear end <b>106</b>. The frame <b>102</b> includes a pair of arms, for example, a first arm <b>112</b> and a second arm <b>114</b> arranged spaced apart from and substantially parallel to the first arm <b>112</b>, arranged at the front end <b>104</b> of the frame <b>102</b>. The arms <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> are connected to the planting unit <b>300</b> and enables a pivotal coupling of the closing unit <b>100</b> relative to the planting unit <b>300</b> about a pivot axis <b>120</b> that passes through holes <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> of the arms <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> and is aligned with central axes of the holes <b>122</b>, <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Further, the frame <b>102</b> further includes at least one support bar, for example a first support bar <b>128</b> and a second support bar <b>130</b> extending downwardly from longitudinal sides <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> of the frame <b>102</b>, and is adapted to support at least one coulter blade, for example, a first coulter blade <b>132</b> and a second coulter blade <b>134</b>. As shown, the first support bar <b>128</b> is arranged proximate to the arms <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> or the front end <b>104</b> of the frame and extends downwardly from a first longitudinal side <b>108</b> of the frame <b>102</b>, while the second support bar <b>130</b> extends downwardly from a second longitudinal side <b>110</b> of the frame <b>102</b> and is disposed proximate to the arms <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> or the front end <b>104</b> of the frame <b>102</b>. Accordingly, the first support bar <b>128</b> and the second support bar <b>130</b> are disposed spaced apart from each other and are arranged substantially parallel to each other. It may be appreciated that the support bars <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> may be attached to the frame <b>102</b> by using fasteners, welding, or any other suitable means known in the art. In some embodiments, the support bars <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> and the arms <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> may be integrally formed or welded with the frame <b>102</b>. It may be appreciated that the support bars <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> and the arms <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> are fixedly connected to the frame <b>102</b> to prevent any relative motion of the arms <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> and support bars <b>128</b>, <b>130</b> relative to the frame <b>102</b>. The first coulter blade <b>132</b> is adapted to rotate relative to the first support bar <b>128</b>, while the second coulter blade <b>134</b> is adapted to rotate relative to the second support bar <b>130</b>. Further, the coulter blades <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> roll on the surface as the closing unit <b>100</b> is linearly displaced. The coulter blades <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> are arranged to laterally displace soil inwardly toward the opposing coulter blades <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> and thereby fill a furrow or opening or seed groove into which seeds have been deposited.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Moreover, the closing unit <b>100</b> includes a basket assembly <b>140</b> having a fork <b>142</b> fixedly attached to the rear end <b>106</b> of the frame <b>102</b> and extending rearwardly and downwardly from the frame <b>102</b>. As shown, the fork <b>142</b> includes a first fork arm <b>144</b> fixedly connected to the first longitudinal side <b>108</b> of the frame <b>102</b> and a second fork arm <b>146</b> fixedly attached to the second longitudinal side <b>110</b> of the frame <b>102</b>. The first fork arm <b>144</b> and the second fork arm <b>146</b> extend rearwardly and obliquely from the frame <b>102</b> and arranged spaced apart from each other and defines a gap <b>150</b> therebetween. Also, the basket assembly <b>140</b> includes a rolling basket <b>152</b> arranged inside the gap <b>150</b> and attached to the two fork arms <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>. The basket <b>152</b> is attached to the fork arms <b>144</b>, <b>146</b> such that the basket <b>152</b> is adapted to rotate about its central axis <b>154</b> relative to the fork arms <b>144</b>, <b>146</b>. Additionally, the basket <b>152</b> is a cylindrical structure having two end caps <b>156</b>, <b>158</b> with a first end cap <b>156</b> coupled to the first fork arm <b>144</b> and a second end cap <b>158</b> coupled to the second fork arm <b>146</b>, and a plurality of spokes <b>160</b> extending arrayed circularly around the central axis <b>154</b> and extending from the first end cap <b>156</b> to the second end cap <b>158</b>. Also, it may be appreciated that the spokes <b>160</b> are arranged such that a gap exist between two consecutive/neighboring/adjacent spokes <b>160</b>. In some embodiments, the spokes <b>160</b> extend obliquely to the end caps <b>156</b>, <b>158</b>. Preferably, the spokes <b>160</b> are arranged at a 50-degree to 70-degree angle relative to the end caps <b>156</b>, <b>158</b>. This helps to ensure proper compaction and finishing of the soil surface while simultaneously preventing clogging of the basket <b>152</b> with mud when used in wet conditions. Alternatively, the spokes <b>160</b> may be arranged substantially perpendicularly to the end caps <b>156</b>, <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Additionally, or optionally, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, a top plate <b>162</b> of the frame <b>102</b> defines an elongated channel <b>164</b> and a plurality of cut-outs, for example, a first cut-out <b>166</b>, a second cut-out <b>168</b>, and a third cut-out <b>170</b> corresponding to a plurality of positions of a lever <b>172</b> that enables a control of pressing force applied by the rolling basket <b>152</b> on the soil. As shown, the lever <b>172</b> includes a first end <b>174</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) attached to an end of a spring <b>176</b> (best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) and a second end <b>178</b> having a handle <b>180</b> to enable a movement of the lever <b>172</b> between the plurality of positions. The first end <b>174</b> includes a pin <b>181</b> which is attached to the frame <b>102</b>. As shown, the first cut-out <b>166</b> is arranged proximate to the front end <b>104</b> of the frame <b>102</b>, the second cut-out <b>168</b> is arranged between the first cut-out <b>166</b> and the third cut-out <b>170</b>, and the third cutout <b>170</b> is arranged proximate to the rear end <b>106</b> of the frame <b>102</b>. It may be appreciated that the first cut-out <b>166</b> corresponds to a first position of the lever <b>172</b>, the second cut-out <b>168</b> corresponds to a second position of the lever <b>172</b>, and the third cut-out <b>170</b> corresponds to a third position of the lever <b>172</b>. The pressing force applied by the rolling basket <b>152</b> on soil increases when the lever <b>172</b> is moved from the first position to the third position. The pressing force increases from the first position to the third position due to the pivotal movement of the closing unit <b>100</b> in a downward direction towards the soil as the lever <b>172</b> is moved from the first position to the third position. The pressing force increases as another end of the spring <b>176</b> is attached to the planting unit <b>300</b>, and the spring <b>176</b> gets compressed or stretched as the lever <b>172</b> is moved between various positions. Also, the top plate <b>162</b> defines a plurality of detents, for example, a first detent <b>182</b>, a second detent <b>184</b>, and a third detent <b>186</b> to hold the lever <b>172</b> at the first position, the second position, and the third position, respectively and prevent the movement of the lever <b>172</b> from the first cut-out <b>166</b>, the second cut-out <b>168</b>, and the third cut-out <b>170</b>, respectively.</p>
