<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates generally to improvements in apparatus for placing material. Among other uses, the present invention may provide the capability to accurately place materials in locations that are difficult to reach.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There is a need for methods and apparatus to accurately place materials. For example, and not meant to be limiting, to create a level concrete surface, concrete is typically first placed inside of forms that define the outer perimeter of the slab. While the concrete is still in a &#x201c;workable&#x201d; state, meaning a fluid or semi-fluid state, a workman will engage in the process of &#x201c;floating&#x201d; or smoothing the concrete. During this process, it is frequently the case that a large slab will have a low spot that is not level with the remainder of the slab. To make the low spot level, it is often desirable to add additional concrete at that location. However, it is often the case that the low spot will be far from the edge of the slab, thereby preventing a workman from accurately placing material on the desired spot without putting weight on the slab, and potentially creating a new low spot that is not level with the remainder of the concrete.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There is therefore a need for improved methods and devices for placing materials in remote locations. Among other advantages, and not meant to be limiting, the present invention provides that capability.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention may include a device having a scoop attached to a pole for precisely placing material in a distant location. Preferably, but not meant to be limiting, the angle between the pole and the scoop is between 14 and 20 degrees, and is ideally 17 degrees.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will nevertheless be understood that no limitations of the inventive scope is thereby intended, as the scope of this invention should be evaluated with reference to the claims appended hereto. Alterations and further modifications in the illustrated devices, and such further applications of the principles of the invention as illustrated herein are contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art to which the invention relates.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">One exemplary embodiment of the present invention is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the present invention may include a pole <b>1</b> attached to a scoop <b>2</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the pole <b>1</b> may include multiple sections <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b>, capable of being attached to one and another. As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the pole <b>1</b> is at least five times the length of the scoop <b>2</b>, and is preferably at least twenty five times the length of the scoop <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, but not meant to be limiting, the scoop <b>2</b> has an internal volume of at least 1 cup. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, and also preferred, but not meant to be limiting, the scoop <b>2</b> has a generally flat bottom. While a curved bottom is also acceptable, it has been the inventor's experience that a flat bottom makes it easier for a workman to load the scoop <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As an example, and not meant to be limiting, it is often the case that when placing, leveling or smoothing a large concrete slab, a low spot will develop in the slab. Often, the low spot will be far away enough from the edge of the slab that a workman cannot place material on the low spot without walking, or otherwise putting their weight on, the slab, which in turn ruins the finish of the slab. The present invention allows a workman to accurately and quickly fill such low spot with material from a distance, thus allowing the workman to fill low spots far from the edge of the slab and provide a flat, level slab.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The concrete that is used to fill the low spot is often excess concrete that was placed on the ground, and not used to form the slab. When a workman uses the present invention to fill the scoop <b>2</b> with concrete, having too shallow of an angle between the pole <b>1</b> and the scoop <b>2</b> will often result in the scoop <b>2</b> digging into the concrete and hitting the ground beneath the excess concrete. This results in a mixture of dirt and concrete being placed in the scoop <b>2</b>, which is undesirable because putting dirt in the slab will create a defect in the slab.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Conversely, having the scoop <b>2</b> at too steep of an angle can make it difficult to load the scoop <b>2</b> because it will glance off of the concrete.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> is an illustration showing he angle between the pole <b>1</b> and the scoop <b>2</b> at 17 degrees. While not meant to be limiting, the inventors have found that an angle of between 14 and 20 degrees is preferred, and an angle of 17 degrees is optimal for the operation of the present invention.</p>
