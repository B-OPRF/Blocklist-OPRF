<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Immaterial modifications may be made to the embodiments described here without departing from what is covered by the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A seed includes an embryonic plant enclosed in a protective outer covering. The formation of the seed is part of the process of reproduction in seed plants. Seed plants dominate biological niches on land, from forests to grasslands both in hot and cold climates. Seeds are also used in agriculture, to plant various crops in open fields. The term seed also has a general meaning that antedates the above&#x2014;anything that can be sown, e.g. &#x201c;seed&#x201d; potatoes, &#x201c;seeds&#x201d; of corn or sunflower &#x201c;seeds&#x201d;. In the case of sunflower and corn &#x201c;seeds&#x201d;, what is sown is the seed enclosed in a shell or husk, whereas the potato is a tuber. Many structures commonly referred to as &#x201c;seeds&#x201d; are actually dry fruits. Plants producing berries are called baccate Sunflower seeds are sometimes sold commercially while still enclosed within the hard wall of the fruit, which must be split open to reach the seed. Different groups of plants have other modifications, the so-called stone fruits (such as the peach) have a hardened fruit layer (the endocarp) fused to and surrounding the actual seed. Nuts are the one-seeded, hard-shelled fruit of some plants with an indehiscent seed, such as an acorn or hazelnut.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Seed germination and subsequent plant growth may be stimulated in various ways. Plants may be inoculated in a variety of ways, including indirect methods and direct methods. Indirect methods include mixing the inoculant into planting and germination mixtures or seed priming media, or applying the inoculant to aboveground portions of plants. Direct methods include inoculating the seeds&#x2014;coating seeds of the plant with an inoculant or inoculants. Direct application of active ingredients to seeds may allow for a reduction, relative to indirect application, in the amount of treatment composition that would otherwise be required to be applied to soil after or during planting. Post or pre-planting soil treatment applications (indirect methods) may have disadvantages relative to seed coating (direct methods). Soil treatments may not penetrate the soil to a sufficient level or location where such may be effective, and such may be whether dependent, and otherwise not as economical as direct seed application (seed coating).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some cases, inoculants or other active agents may be mixed in downstream or upstream methods. On-farm or on-site downstream methods may involve the farmer or gardener mixing the inoculant and the seed together by hand or batch mixing before or during seed loading into the planting equipment. Alternatively, pre-inoculation upstream techniques may be used where the seeds are prepared by a manufacturer or other upstream party.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Seed inoculation&#x2014;also known as seed coating&#x2014;is a technique used to as an aid to improve one or more of seed appearance, handling characteristics, active compound delivery, and germination. Seed coating includes the application of ingredients such as a binder (such as an adhesive polymeric liquid), filler or carrier medium (for example a powder), and active ingredient or active ingredients (sometimes called inoculants, for example beneficial microorganisms). In some cases, one or more of the binder, filler, and active ingredient function as two or more of the binder, filler, and active ingredient. Active ingredients may include, but are not limited to, fertilizers, fungicides, nutritional elements, moisture agents, plant growth regulators, and pesticides, which are applied onto the exterior surface of the seeds. Seed coating may improve stress resistance, improve disease resistance, accelerate germination, promote seedling formation, and otherwise increase yield and improve crop quality. Once seeds are sown into the soil, the agents that coat the seeds may absorb water and release, providing the seeds with a good germination environment and suitable seedling growth conditions. Some coatings may be selected to have a controlled release effect, to release slowly over time to provide the seed with a steady supply of the active ingredient(s) present in the coating as needed by the seed.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Seed coating may provide a film coating on the seeds, along with a filler such as a powder that contains the desired active agent or agents. In some cases, the filler/powder containing active agents may be mixed prior to application to ensure proper mixing with the binder, and thus even application of the agents. In some cases, the binder is applied first to the seed exterior, followed by application of the active agent and any filler thereafter to the wet coating around the seed. In some cases, an assembly line application, manual application, or cyclic oscillatory device may be used for coating application.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A seed coating machine may be used to apply the seed coating. Various machines for treatment of seeds in batch or continuous treatment mode are known. An efficient method of batch treatment may include a device that calculates the amount of treatment dispersed using the relative flow rate of the seeds or batch size of seeds through the machine. Some batch methods include a stir-pot application. In some cases of batch mixing, a device may use a barrel or drum in which seeds and a coating is applied, with some form of rotating arm to stir or mix the solution with the seeds, and/or the device itself may oscillate or rotate to ensure uniform coating. Coating applications may also be carried out via a continuous process, such as via a conveyor belt application or a spray unit application. In some cases what is termed a continuous batch mixing method is used, where a batch mixing technique is leveraged to produce a relatively continuous flow of coated seeds, albeit in a series of batches.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, a batch seed coating device <b>10</b> is illustrated. The device <b>10</b> may comprise a part that dispenses seeds, a part that dispenses seed coating, a part that mixes the seeds and seed coating, and a part that discharges the coated seeds, although some embodiments disclosed herein may have one or more of the foregoing parts. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, the device <b>10</b> may comprise a housing <b>12</b>, such as a drum as shown, that forms a seed mixing bowl <b>11</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, a stirring part, such as a mixing table <b>18</b>, may be mounted to stir, about a rotational axis <b>18</b>J (Figs. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>, in use the mixture of seeds <b>52</b> and seed coating <b>54</b> may be mixed within the interior <b>12</b>I in a direction <b>18</b>K of stirring rotation around the rotational axis <b>18</b>J. A controller <b>36</b> may be connected to operate any one or more aspects of the device <b>10</b> or subsystems.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>9</b> and <b>27</b>-<b>28</b></figref>, the housing <b>12</b> may have suitable characteristics. In the example shown a vertical mixing drum is shown, although horizontal, tilted (such as similar to a concrete mixer), and other drum orientations may be used. The housing <b>12</b> may have a cylindrical side wall <b>12</b>B, although in other cases two, three, four or more walls may be used, in addition to other more complex shapes. The housing <b>12</b> may be open topped or may have a top wall or roof <b>12</b>A. The housing <b>12</b> may be open bottomed or may have a base <b>12</b>D. The cylindrical side wall <b>12</b>B may define a central axis <b>12</b>J, which in the example shown is coaxial with the axis <b>18</b>J.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, the housing <b>12</b> may have a suitable stirring part. In the example shown a rotary mixing table <b>18</b> is present in interior <b>12</b>I. The rotary table <b>18</b> may form an inner bowl that nests within the seed mixing bowl <b>11</b>, for example that nests within a catch basin <b>13</b>. Basin <b>13</b> may be nested within and anchored to interior surfaces of the side wall <b>12</b>B above the base <b>12</b>D within interior <b>12</b>I. A power source may be provided to rotate the stirring part, for example a motor <b>24</b> with a suitable power transfer such as a gearbox or transmission <b>26</b> may be provided to turn table <b>18</b>. Table <b>18</b> may be mounted for rotation within the housing <b>12</b>, for example a drive shaft <b>18</b>E of table <b>18</b> may be mounted one or more bearings such as bearings <b>46</b> and <b>50</b> in base <b>12</b>D and basin <b>13</b>, respectively. The basin <b>13</b> may have tapered side walls <b>13</b>B, which may be sloped down toward a base <b>13</b>D with decreasing radial distance from side wall <b>12</b>B. The table <b>18</b> may be mounted over or on a top surface <b>13</b>A of basin <b>13</b>. The table <b>18</b> may have tapered side walls <b>18</b>B, which may be sloped down toward a base <b>18</b>D with decreasing radial distance from side wall <b>12</b>B. A top bowl surface <b>18</b>A may be defined on the table <b>18</b>, for conveying seeds <b>52</b> and seed coating <b>54</b> to rotate within the housing <b>12</b>. The stirring part may comprise various flutes or paddles or blades, to convey rotational motion. The stirring part may comprise various arms or other parts to achieve its function.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>9</b> and <b>27</b>-<b>29</b></figref>, the housing <b>12</b> may incorporate a plurality of mixing blades <b>28</b> to facilitate mixing within interior <b>12</b>I. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>28</b></figref>, the plurality of mixing blades <b>28</b> may be angularly spaced around the interior <b>12</b>I of the housing <b>12</b>, for example at relative angles <b>28</b>H&#x2032; and <b>28</b>H&#x2033; defined about axis <b>12</b>J of the housing <b>12</b>. A leading face <b>28</b>E of each mixing blade <b>28</b> may be angled inward to direct the mixture, for example slurry, radially inward. By directing the mixture radially inward as the mixture rotates (for example under the compulsion of a stirring part such as table <b>18</b>), the mixture remains dynamic with seeds moving over seeds and contacting seed coating for efficient coating application. The leading faces <b>28</b>E may be angled radially inward (toward the center axis <b>12</b>J) along a direction <b>18</b>K of rotation about the rotational axis (<b>12</b>J or <b>18</b>J) to in use direct the mixture radially inward. Relative to a system that incorporates blades <b>28</b> mounted radially (ninety degrees relative to side wall <b>12</b>B), blades <b>28</b> that define the relatively softer angles shown may reduce back pressure in the stirring mixture, which may reduce damage to the seeds. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>28</b> and <b>29</b></figref>, the angles <b>28</b>G defined may be obtuse angles when measured from a theoretical circumference of rotation (for example shown by the interior surfaces of the side wall <b>12</b>B) defined about the rotational axis <b>12</b>J. The leading face <b>28</b>E is understood as the face that faces or leads into the flow of the mixture about the direction of rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>-<b>33</b></figref>, the blades <b>28</b> may incorporate suitable characteristics. In some cases, the blades <b>28</b> are made of rigid material, such as metal, while in other cases the blades <b>28</b> may be formed of flexible or resilient material such as polymeric materials. The mixing blades <b>28</b> may have a suitable shape. For example, the blades <b>28</b> may be tapered with increasing distance from the cylindrical side wall <b>12</b>B in a direction toward a top wall or roof <b>12</b>A (not shown) of the housing <b>12</b>. To illustrate the tapering, the images shown a blade <b>28</b> that has a tapered base edge <b>28</b>B that extends from a base end <b>28</b>I toward a top end <b>28</b>A. An inner edge <b>28</b>C with a relatively non-tapered zone may be present, for example between the edge <b>28</b>B and top end <b>28</b>A. The corners between adjacent edges may be beveled as shown, for example to reduce the potential for damage to the seeds during use.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>27</b>-<b>33</b></figref>, the blades <b>28</b> may anchor to the interior surfaces of the side wall <b>12</b>B of housing <b>12</b>, for example using anchors, such as anchor plates or arms <b>28</b>F. Each anchor arm <b>28</b>F may be extended from a rear face <b>28</b>L or outer edge <b>28</b>D of the mixing blade <b>28</b>. The anchor arms <b>28</b>F may be secured to a side wall <b>12</b>B of the interior of the seed mixing bowl, by a suitable mechanism such as by fasteners <b>29</b> passed through respective slots <b>28</b> in each bar or blade <b>28</b>. The anchor arms <b>28</b>F may be arcuate or planar, or other suitable shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>30</b>-<b>31</b> and <b>30</b>A-<b>31</b>A</figref>, different configurations of blades <b>28</b> may be used. Different sizes and shapes of blades <b>28</b> may be used. The blades of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>30</b>A and <b>31</b>A</figref> may be shorter than the blades <b>28</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>30</b> and <b>31</b></figref>. In some cases blades <b>28</b> of relatively different lengths and dimensions are used in the same device <b>10</b>, as such may increase the efficiency of the mixing process. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, different relative angular spacings may be used, leading to relative angles <b>28</b>H&#x2032; and <b>28</b>H&#x2033; that differ from one another in the same housing <b>12</b>. Different angles <b>28</b>G of advancement may be used among blades <b>28</b> in the same housing <b>12</b>. Differences in angles, shape, and position may increase efficiency of the mixing process. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>9</b> and <b>27</b></figref>, each blade <b>28</b> may be mounted at a suitable location within interior <b>12</b>I of housing <b>12</b>. For example, each blade <b>28</b> shown is mounted so that the base end <b>28</b>I is above the table <b>18</b>, as well as above the tapered side walls <b>13</b>B and <b>18</b>B of the basin <b>13</b> and table <b>18</b>, respectively. In some cases, the blades <b>28</b> may reduce mixing time relative to a process that does not incorporate blades <b>28</b> or incorporates radially oriented blades <b>28</b>. In some cases, mixing times may be cut in half or more. A reduction in residence time within the housing <b>12</b> while being stirred puts less force on the seeds, reducing the potential for seed damage. Often times when a seed is damaged it will be useless, such as is the case with raw peanuts that break in half. A reduction in mixing speed and stirring time also reduces power requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, the device <b>10</b> may have a suitable system for supplying seeds to the housing <b>12</b>. In a batch treatment the amount of seed treatment provided to seeds may be determined by the weight of seeds, for example, X volume of treatment fluid for Y weight of seeds. A useful measurement to determine the amount of treatment required, as well as controlling the rate of coating, may be based on a calculation or estimation of the total surface area of the seeds. In some cases, one or more of volume, weight, seed counting, or other suitable methods may be used to measure out a sufficient charge (predetermined level) of seeds to supply to the housing <b>12</b>. The weight of the seeds may vary with humidity and other factors whereas the volume of seed correlates more directly with the surface area of the seed. In some cases, a seed supply system such as incorporating hopper <b>14</b> may dispense plural charges into the housing <b>12</b> during a coating process or prior to a coating process to make up a sufficient seed level in the housing <b>12</b> for a coating process.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, in the example shown, a weigh bucket, such as a scale hopper <b>14</b> may be provided. A weigh bucket may incorporate a weight sensor to assist in measuring a predetermined charge of seeds to dispense into the housing <b>12</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>-<b>26</b></figref>, a weight sensor may incorporate a pressure transducer or other sensor, for example on or in or associated with an actuator <b>15</b>B that operates a seed discharge gate assembly <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, in use, the seed mixing bowl (housing <b>12</b>) may be connected to receive seed from the weigh bucket. The scale hopper <b>14</b> may be suspended above the housing <b>12</b>, or otherwise in a position where seed may be dispensed from the hopper <b>14</b> into the housing <b>12</b>, such as via a conduit (not shown). In the example shown the scale hopper <b>14</b> mates with the roof <b>12</b>A of housing <b>12</b> to provide the hopper <b>14</b> with direct access to the interior <b>12</b>I of housing <b>12</b>. The hopper <b>14</b> may secure, for example by fasteners or welding or other suitable mechanisms, to roof <b>12</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>21</b>-<b>26</b></figref>, the hopper <b>14</b> (weigh bucket) may have suitable parts: the hopper <b>14</b> may have one or more side wall, such as four side walls <b>14</b>B as shown. The hopper <b>14</b> may have a suitable shape, such as a rectangular box, although other shapes may be used such as that of a cylinder, or a structure whose cross-section is that of a polygon, a triangle, or a trapezoid. The hopper <b>14</b> may be structured to receive seed from a seed supply source, for example via one or more openings, such as an open top end <b>14</b>A. In other cases, the top of the hopper <b>14</b> may be closed or have a gate over the opening. The hopper <b>14</b> may form a duct that conveys seeds from a seed supply source to the housing <b>12</b>, for example through an interior <b>14</b>I along a path defined by a hopper axis <b>14</b>J. A peripheral flange <b>14</b>M may line top end <b>14</b>A, for example for reinforcement or other purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>21</b>-<b>26</b></figref>, a suitable mechanism may be provided for discharging seeds from the weigh bucket hopper <b>14</b> into the mixing bowl housing <b>12</b>. A discharge gate <b>15</b>A may be provided for such a purpose. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>26</b></figref>, the discharge gate <b>15</b>A may be structured to swing down and up relative to an open base end <b>14</b>D of the weigh bucket hopper <b>14</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a closed position where the gate <b>15</b>A is swung up, for example to converge with a base flange <b>15</b>F of the assembly <b>15</b>.

Other mechanisms may be used to dispense seeds from the weigh bucket into the housing <b>12</b>, for example the weigh bucket may be structured to rotate to dump the seeds out of the top or another opening in the weigh bucket.

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>21</b>-<b>26</b></figref>, the discharge gate assembly <b>15</b> may have suitable parts for operation. In the example shown the assembly <b>15</b> is structured to fit over or onto or into the open base end <b>14</b>D of hopper <b>14</b>. The assembly <b>15</b> may have a peripheral flange <b>15</b>F, which in the example shown fits over the base end <b>14</b>D, with side walls <b>15</b>G that fit part way up the side walls <b>14</b>B. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b> and <b>25</b></figref>, base flange <b>15</b>F defines a discharge opening <b>15</b>I, over which the gate <b>15</b>A moves to cover or uncover the opening <b>15</b>I. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>-<b>26</b></figref>, the gate <b>15</b>A may form a flap as shown, such as a planar plate that swings. The gate <b>15</b>A may be pivotally connected at a mounting end <b>15</b>A-<b>1</b> to the hopper <b>14</b> (assembly <b>15</b>) via a hinge <b>15</b>D, the mounting end <b>15</b>A-<b>1</b> opposite a discharge or leading end <b>15</b>A-<b>2</b>. One or both the hopper <b>14</b> and assembly <b>15</b> may be structured to funnel seeds toward opening <b>15</b>I, for example assembly <b>15</b> may include guide parts such as downwardly sloped ramps <b>15</b>H to direct seeds into opening <b>15</b>I.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>21</b>-<b>26</b></figref>, one or more actuators <b>15</b>B may be connected to open and close the gate <b>15</b>A. In the example shown the actuators <b>15</b>B are mounted within respective cavities defined under the ramps <b>15</b>H. In other cases, actuators <b>15</b>B are mounted outside the hopper <b>14</b>, for example to the side walls <b>14</b>B or underside of hopper <b>14</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>26</b></figref>, the actuators <b>15</b>B may be mounted to interior surfaces of a rear wall <b>14</b>B-<b>2</b> opposite a front wall <b>14</b>B-<b>1</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>24</b>-<b>26</b></figref>, the actuators <b>15</b>B may connect to gate <b>15</b>A at or near mounting end <b>15</b>A-<b>1</b>, for example by connecting to respective cam brackets or arms <b>15</b>E at mounting ends <b>15</b>A-<b>1</b>. In the example shown the actuators <b>15</b>B are extended to put the gate <b>15</b>A in the closed position, and the actuators <b>15</b>B retract to pull the cam arms <b>15</b>E and rotate the gate <b>15</b>A into the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>21</b>-<b>26</b></figref>, the hopper <b>14</b> may be structured to dispense seeds into the housing <b>12</b> in a way that minimizes or avoids seed damage. In some cases, it may be advantageous to structure the discharge to increase the chance that discharged seeds land on seeds, rather than on hard surfaces of the housing <b>12</b>. For example, it is advantageous to have peanuts landing on peanuts. The gate <b>15</b>A may be structured as a horizontal or laterally oriented door, that swings down slowly or gradually to release seeds so that initial seeds are lowered slowly into the flow of seeds in the housing <b>12</b>, with the balance of the seeds landing on other seeds that are already revolving. A conventional approach is to dump the seeds quickly and directly straight down or into the center of the machine, although such may increase the change of damages the seeds, as well as other parts of the device <b>10</b> such as the rotating disc or other coating dispersion device <b>20</b> (shown as a rotor in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>-<b>9</b></figref>) or associated components, bearings, or other internal parts. In one case the gate <b>15</b>A is operated to move less than sixty degrees between open and closed, for example forty-five degrees or less. In some cases, the gate <b>15</b>A is structured to open to a maximum of sixty degrees off horizontal while dispensing seeds. The gate <b>15</b>A may be structured to form a chute. The discharge gate <b>15</b>A may be structured to direct discharged seeds laterally out of the weigh bucket hopper <b>14</b> for example laterally and downwardly. The gate <b>15</b>A may be operated to swing down sufficiently slowly that the entire charge of seeds contained within interior <b>14</b>I is discharged before reaching the open position. The gate <b>15</b>A may be positioned to direct the seeds laterally toward the side wall <b>12</b>B of the housing <b>12</b>, as during rotation of the mixture in the housing <b>12</b> the seeds therein will collect around the side wall <b>12</b>B thereby increasing the chance of seeds landing on seeds. The discharge gate <b>15</b>A may form a scoop, for example with side walls (not shown). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>9</b></figref> a controller <b>36</b> may be connected to operate the gate <b>15</b>A, for example to initiate gate <b>15</b>A to discharge at a controlled rate when desired to do so (for example when a full charge is received by hopper <b>14</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>9</b>, <b>11</b>-<b>20</b>, and <b>26</b></figref>, a seed scale fill system may be provided, for example incorporating a fill hopper <b>16</b>. The scale fill system may be provided to fill a weighing or measuring system, such as the weigh bucket hopper <b>14</b>, although in some cases hopper <b>16</b> or a structure made with the same principles and parts may be provided to dispense seeds directly into the housing <b>12</b>. The fill hopper <b>16</b> may have one or more side walls <b>16</b>B, for example front, rear and lateral walls <b>16</b>B-<b>1</b>, <b>16</b>B-<b>2</b>, and <b>16</b>B-<b>3</b>, respectively. The hopper <b>16</b> may define a seed discharge opening <b>16</b>D, such as an open base end as shown (with the term open base end or open end/open top referring to a structure that defines an opening irrespective of whether a gate is associated with the opening and in a closed or open position). In other cases, the opening may be a lateral opening, such as in a side wall <b>16</b>B. A suitable gate, such as an articulating gate <b>17</b> or gate assembly, may be provided for opening and closing the opening <b>16</b>D. In use the weigh bucket may be connected to receive seeds from the seed discharge opening. The hopper <b>16</b> may have a peripheral flange <b>16</b>K at its top end <b>16</b>A. Seeds may travel through hopper <b>16</b> along a central axis <b>16</b>J defined by hopper <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>20</b></figref>, the articulating gate <b>17</b> may be structured to move through a range of positions including open, closed, and one or more intermediate, positions to provide different discharge flow rates. The articulating gate <b>17</b> may be movable between: a closed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>15</b></figref>), an open position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>19</b>-<b>20</b></figref>), and a trickle position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>-<b>18</b></figref>). In use, seeds may be supplied into the fill hopper. The articulating gate <b>17</b> may be manipulated into an open position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>19</b></figref>) to pour the seeds into a weigh bucket. The articulating gate <b>17</b> may be manipulated into a trickle position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>) to meter seeds into the weigh bucket. The articulating gate <b>17</b> may thereafter be closed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>) when the weigh bucket is at a predetermined fill level.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the gate <b>17</b> may be structured to reduce or avoid damaging seeds <b>52</b> that are contained within the hopper <b>16</b> or being transferred out of the hopper <b>16</b>. When in the closed position the articulating gate <b>17</b> may have sufficient clearance <b>56</b> from the fill hopper <b>16</b> to avoid pinch points. For example, a clearance <b>56</b> may be selected to be greater than an average diameter of seed <b>52</b> used in a process, for example equal to or greater (for example 5, 10, 15, or 20% greater or larger) than a maximum diameter of seeds transferred. Despite the clearance, the gate <b>17</b> may be structured to close without releasing seeds when in the closed position. For example, as discussed further below, the gate <b>17</b> may curl up at its terminal end to prevent seeds that pass through the clearance <b>56</b> from being discharged from the hopper <b>16</b>. Hopper <b>16</b> may be used a scale fill mechanism above the drum (housing <b>12</b>) for measuring a next batch of seeds while a previous batch is mixing in the drum&#x2014;such an approach is an example of continuous batching. A more conventional approach would be to use a pinch point creating door or claw, which fractures high value seed that becomes inadvertent stuck between the door and hopper. A vibratory feeder may be used to scale fill, although such may not achieve the same capacity as an articulating gate <b>17</b> system, which may achieve in a peanut coating application capacities of thirty tonnes per hour or more. The gate <b>17</b> shown functions as a scoop door that does not pinch, and whose finger tip/or wrist part allows a trickle speed to slow filling at the end of a measuring stage to permit a weigh scale to catch up and avoid loading errors due to in-flight effects (seeds that are in the air and have not been weighed but have technically been discharged into the hopper <b>14</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>20</b></figref>, the articulating gate <b>17</b> may comprise a plurality of flaps pivotally connected together. The articulating gate <b>17</b> may comprise a first flap, such as a main door flap <b>17</b>A pivotally connected to the fill hopper <b>16</b>. For example, a mounting end <b>17</b>A-<b>1</b> of flap <b>17</b>A may pivotally connect to a side wall <b>16</b>B-<b>1</b> or another suitable location on hopper <b>16</b>. The gate <b>17</b> may comprise a second flap <b>17</b>D pivotally connected to the first flap <b>17</b>A. For example, a mounting end <b>17</b>D-<b>1</b> of flap <b>17</b>D may pivotally connect to a discharge or flap end <b>17</b>A-<b>2</b> of flap <b>17</b>A or at another suitable location on flap <b>17</b>A. The ends <b>17</b>A-<b>2</b> and <b>17</b>A-<b>1</b> may be opposite to one another as shown, so that the flaps curl up and down similar to the movement of joint of a finger. Three, four, or more flaps may be used in the gate <b>17</b>. The use of plural flaps permits a relatively wider range of intermediate positions between open and closed, which may be leveraged to provide a metering effect on the seeds within the hopper <b>16</b> to control flow.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>20</b></figref>, the articulating gate <b>17</b> may be located at a suitable location on the hopper <b>14</b>. As above gate <b>17</b> may cover a seed discharge opening <b>14</b>D in an open base end of the hopper <b>14</b>, for example if the seed discharge opening is defined in a base of the fill hopper <b>14</b>. The first flap <b>17</b>A may be connected to swing down and up below the seed discharge opening to converge with and diverge from, respectively, the open base end. The second flap <b>17</b>D may be connected to swing down and up relative to the first flap. In the example shown each pivotal connection defines a pivot axis, for example plural pivot axes defined by the pivot points provided by hinges <b>17</b>K and <b>17</b>G, defined between the first flap and the fill hopper (hinge <b>17</b>K) and the first flap and the second flap (hinge <b>17</b>G). The plural pivot axes may be one or both parallel and horizontal, with both cases shown in the Figures. The flaps <b>17</b>A and <b>17</b>D are able to fold up and down in an articulating fashion as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>20</b></figref>, the gate <b>17</b> may be structured to assume a trickle position as desired. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, the first flap <b>17</b>A may be closed or otherwise in a converged position to permit the trickle position to be configured. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>20</b></figref>, thus, in one case, the gate <b>17</b> may move between an open position is defined when the first flap is open (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>19</b>-<b>20</b></figref>), the trickle position when the first flap is closed but the second flap is open (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b> and <b>16</b>-<b>18</b></figref>), and the closed position when the first flap and the second flap are closed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>15</b></figref>). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>18</b></figref>, the first flap <b>17</b>A may be pivotally connected to the first wall <b>16</b>B-<b>2</b>. When the first flap <b>17</b>A is in a converged position, the first flap <b>17</b>A may block the seed discharge opening <b>16</b>D except for a seed trickle gap (clearance <b>56</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>) defined between the seed discharge opening and the first flap. The seed trickle gap may be defined between the second wall <b>16</b>B-<b>1</b> and the discharge or flap end <b>17</b>D-<b>2</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>15</b>-<b>17</b></figref>, as above the gap may be structured to permit lateral movement of the seeds through the seed discharge opening below the second wall when the second flap is open (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>-<b>17</b></figref>). Thus, when the gate <b>17</b>A is converged as shown, and the flap <b>17</b>D is open, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>17</b></figref>, trickling (metering) may occur. Trickling may refer to controlled metering. In some cases, in the open position seed flux may be reduced by seventy to ninety percent or more when in the trickle position relative to the open position. In other cases, a trickling position may be assumed when the main flap <b>17</b>A is not in a completely converged position, for example the flaps <b>17</b>A and <b>17</b>D may cooperate to define a trickle position without either or without one of them being in an extreme position in a range of relative pivoting motion.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>18</b></figref>, the first flap <b>17</b>A may be structured to facilitate trickling when converged. As shown the flap <b>17</b>A may form a seed ramp that is sloped downward toward the flap end <b>17</b>A-<b>2</b> of the first flap <b>17</b>A. Thus, when converged (closed or trickle position), seeds will be drawn by gravity down the ramp toward the gap provided by clearance <b>56</b>. To facilitate such an effect, base edges <b>16</b>C of the third and fourth walls <b>16</b>B-<b>3</b> may be tapered downward toward the second wall <b>16</b>B-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>18</b></figref>, the second flap <b>17</b>D may cooperate with the seed ramp to close and open the trickle gap. When the first flap <b>17</b>A is in the converged position, the second flap <b>17</b>D may be movable between: open (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>-<b>18</b></figref>) where the second flap permits the discharge of seeds, and closed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>15</b></figref>) where the second flap <b>17</b>D is sloped upward away from the flap end <b>17</b>A-<b>2</b> of the first flap <b>17</b>A to block the discharge of seeds. Such a configuration permits the closing the of the gate <b>17</b> without pinching the seeds.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>20</b></figref>, the flaps or one of them may form scoops to control discharge. A scoop may have a base, such as a plate (identified as the parts of the flaps that are identified directly by reference characters <b>17</b>A or <b>17</b>D), and upright side walls. The first flap <b>17</b>A may form a scoop with upright side walls <b>17</b>C. Walls <b>17</b>C may have a suitable shape, such as that of a rounded triangle to cooperate with side walls <b>16</b>B-<b>3</b> to provide a continuous conduit when in the open position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>-<b>20</b></figref>). Side walls <b>17</b>C may cover over exterior (shown) or interior surfaces of the hopper <b>16</b>, although exterior coverage as shown may be less damaging to seeds within the interior <b>16</b>I of the hopper <b>16</b>. The second flap <b>17</b>D may form a scoop with upright side walls <b>17</b>E. Similar to walls <b>17</b>C, walls <b>17</b>E may cover exterior (shown) or interior surfaces of the walls <b>17</b>C, although exterior coverage as shown may be less damaging to seeds within the chute provided by the seed ramp of gate <b>17</b>A. Scoop shapes cooperate to direct seeds to exit the gate <b>17</b>A via a discharge end <b>17</b>D-<b>2</b> of the flap <b>17</b>D, for example to corral the seeds for lateral exit of hopper <b>16</b> toward side walls <b>12</b>B of the housing <b>12</b> or to side wall <b>14</b>B of hopper <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>20</b></figref>, one or more actuators may be used to operate the flaps. One or more actuators <b>17</b>B-<b>1</b> may be connected to pivot the first flap <b>17</b>A relative to the fill hopper <b>16</b>. Actuators <b>17</b>B-<b>1</b> may be mounted to a suitable location on hopper <b>16</b>. In the example shown, actuators <b>17</b>B-<b>1</b> are mounted to an underside of flange <b>16</b>K, for example via brackets <b>16</b>M, although such could be mounted on side walls <b>16</b>B or to the top or bottom of the hopper <b>16</b>. Actuators are shown mounted at or near the rear wall <b>16</b>B-<b>2</b>, which is the same wall where the trickle gap is defined and opposite the wall <b>16</b>B-<b>1</b> where the gate <b>17</b> is mounted to pivot from. The actuators <b>17</b>B-<b>1</b> may connect to gate <b>17</b>A at a suitable point, such as closer to the mounting end <b>17</b>A-<b>1</b> of gate <b>17</b>A, for example via brackets <b>17</b>F on side walls <b>17</b>C or at another suitable location on gate <b>17</b>A. In the example shown, by extending actuators <b>17</b>B-<b>1</b>, a torque is induced on flap <b>17</b>A causing such to pivot downward to diverge from the opening <b>16</b>D.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>14</b>-<b>20</b></figref>, one or more actuators <b>17</b>B-<b>2</b> may be connected to pivot the second flap <b>17</b>D relative to the first flap <b>17</b>A. Actuators <b>17</b>B-<b>2</b> may be mounted to a suitable location on hopper <b>16</b> or flap <b>17</b>A. In the example shown, actuators <b>17</b>B-<b>2</b> are mounted to an underside of gate <b>17</b>A, for example via brackets <b>17</b>I, although such could be mounted on side walls <b>16</b>B or to the top or bottom of the hopper <b>16</b>. Actuators are shown mounted near the front wall <b>16</b>B-<b>1</b>, which is the same wall where the gate <b>17</b> is mounted to pivot from. The actuators <b>17</b>B-<b>2</b> may connect to gate <b>17</b>A at a suitable point, such as closer to the mounting end <b>17</b>A-<b>1</b> of gate <b>17</b>A, for example via brackets <b>17</b>I op on side walls <b>17</b>C or at another suitable location on gate <b>17</b>A. Actuators <b>17</b>B-<b>2</b> may mount to an underside of flap <b>17</b>D for example via brackets <b>17</b>H, which are extended lever arms. In the example shown, by extending actuators <b>17</b>B-<b>2</b>, a torque is induced on flap <b>17</b>D causing such to pivot upward about flap end <b>17</b>A-<b>2</b> of gate <b>17</b>A to close. By contrast, a retraction of actuators <b>17</b>B-<b>2</b> will cause flap <b>17</b>D to rotate downward to diverge and open. By mounting the actuators <b>17</b>B-<b>2</b> on flap <b>17</b>A the operation of the flap <b>17</b>D may be made independent of the operation of flap <b>17</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Other systems may be used to provide seeds in a controlled fashion into the weigh bucket or housing <b>12</b>. Seeds may be deposited through a seed inlet, such as a hopper, into a metering portion that may be configured as a seed wheel. A seed metering wheel may include a rotating wheel and pockets of identical depth that are designed to be filled with a precise and identical amount of seeds in each pocket. Another variation of a scale filling system includes a continuous scale system for larger scale operations, and batch weighing hoppers for smaller scale operations.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, a controller <b>36</b> may be used to operate the gate <b>17</b>A. For example, controller <b>36</b> may be connected to operate the articulating gate <b>17</b>A and receive signals from the weight sensor (not shown). The controller <b>36</b> may be programmed to implement a discharge pattern of various positions for gate <b>17</b>A. For example, the controller <b>36</b> may be configured to operate the articulated gate <b>17</b>A to fill the weigh bucket to a predetermined seed fill level by carrying out various steps. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>19</b>-<b>20</b></figref>, the articulated gate <b>17</b>A may be diverged, for example manipulated into an open position to fill the weigh bucket with seeds from the fill hopper <b>16</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>16</b>-<b>18</b></figref>, when the weigh bucket is between an intermediate seed fill level and the predetermined seed fill level, the articulated gate <b>17</b>A may be manipulated into a trickle position shown. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>15</b></figref>, the controller <b>36</b> may be configured to operate the articulated gate <b>17</b>A by, when the weigh bucket is at or near the predetermined seed fill level, moving the articulated gate <b>17</b>A into the closed position. The fill level in the weigh bucket may be determined by suitable methods, such as by measuring weight in the bucket during filling, or by measuring volume or by measuring time assuming a particular flow rate, or using other sensor data such as that from a proximity sensor (not shown). By slowing to a trickle between an intermediate fill level (for example ninety percent full or more) and a full fill level, errors in filling from the time lag caused by sensor lag and drift from moving seeds is eliminated, leaving more accurate measurements to be made possible. In some cases, the controller <b>36</b> operates the gate <b>17</b>A to hold in the trickle position during filling, for example near the beginning or end of a fill cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>9</b> and <b>26</b></figref>, the hoppers <b>14</b> and/or <b>16</b> may be supported in a suitable fashion. In the example shown, an upright structural frame or support stand <b>32</b> may be provided. The stand <b>32</b> may have ground engaging base members such as base beams <b>32</b>D. Beams <b>32</b>D may be hollow to define tine passages <b>32</b>G with suitable dimensions to receive fork tines <b>34</b>B of a pallet jack <b>34</b> or other machine structured to transport the stand <b>32</b> to a suitable location. Base beams <b>32</b>D may be structured to fit underneath the housing <b>12</b> to permit the stand <b>32</b> to be brought into close proximity with housing <b>12</b> for operations. An upright frame such as made with vertical columns <b>32</b>B may extend to a top end <b>32</b>A of the stand <b>32</b>. The stand <b>32</b> may support the hoppers by a suitable fashion, such as with lateral support aims <b>32</b>E and <b>32</b>F or one or both of them.

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>7</b>, <b>28</b>, and <b>34</b></figref>, during use a mixture of seeds and seed coating may be stirred within an interior <b>12</b>I of a seed mixing bowl in a direction <b>18</b>K of stirring rotation around an axis <b>12</b>J of the seed mixing bowl. When mixing is completed to a sufficient degree, or when it is otherwise desired, coated seeds may be discharged from the seed mixing bowl or mixer (housing <b>12</b>). In such a case, the discharge gate <b>31</b>, if present, may be opened to permit seeds to exit the housing <b>12</b> through port <b>12</b>G. The mixture may continue to rotate or be stirred during discharge, for example to improve discharge by leveraging the circumferential force imparted upon the mixture via the stirring action. Coated seeds may be discharged using such rotational energy through discharge port <b>12</b>G in the cylindrical side wall <b>12</b>B into the discharge chute <b>30</b>. Coated seeds that enter the chute <b>30</b> may be collected or transferred to a further container such as a bucket (not shown) or ducting (not shown) in communication with the chute <b>30</b>.</p>

While the treatment is being applied the seed may be folded towards the center by moveable blade <b>28</b>, providing rapid blending of seed in applications either dry or wet, and sweeping seed across the bottom of the rotor pan thereby scrubbing treatment overspray off of the rotor. When treating seed, the drum discharge door may be open, with the rotating mixing bar or blade <b>28</b> rotating a suitable amount such as 90&#xb0; counterclockwise, assisting the seed to discharge much more rapidly, yet more gently then having the seed spin around for a longer period of time (as would be the case without blade <b>28</b>) causing potential damage to the seed.

<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>9</b></figref>, the housing <b>12</b> may incorporate various other mechanisms for mixing seed coating components with seeds within housing <b>12</b>. One or more ports <b>12</b>K may be located in the roof <b>12</b>A, for example for permitting visual inspection of the contents of the interior <b>12</b>I or for permitting addition of various components such as binders, fillers, seeds, or active ingredients. In some cases, liquid adhesive may be supplied via injector <b>38</b>, while one or more of solid or powdered fillers or active ingredients are supplied via ports <b>12</b>K. Any such additives may be measured prior to being poured or injected through ports <b>12</b>K, which may be in side wall <b>12</b>B in some cases.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Suitable adhesives may be used in the seed coating applied to the seeds. An adhesive polymer may be used, such as copolymers of vinyl pyrrolidone and vinyl acetate, poly (methyl vinyl ether) maleic anhydride copolymers, free acids of the copolymer of methyl vinyl ether and maleic anhydride, vinylpyrroldone/styrene copolymers, partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohols, vinyl acetate/butyl acrylate copolymers, vinyl acetate homopolymers, terpolymers, acrylic copolymers, styrene/acrylic estercopolymers, vinyl acetate/ethylene copolymers and polyvinyl acetate. Caseinate salts such as the sodium salt may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Suitable fillers may be used in the seed coating applied to the seeds. The filler/carrier may comprise peat. Alternatively, vermiculite, clay, silt, graphite, talc, filter mud, coir dust, bagasse, composted corn cobs or coal dust may be used. The intermediate or carrier may be relatively finely divided, for example in powder form. Powdered particles capable of passing a screen of 200 mesh may be used, although particles smaller than 75 microns may be used, as may other sizes larger or smaller. These finely-divided powders may be effective, especially in the case of intermediates or carriers such as clays (particularly kaolin), graphite, or charcoal (particularly activated charcoal). Some mechanical interlocking between powdered bacteria and the powdery intermediate may occur, and the irregular jagged edges of the discrete powdery particles of the carrier or intermediate may contribute to a mechanical interlocking with the outer surface of legume seeds, particularly on microscopically irregular surface areas thereof, or such irregular surface areas thereof as, for example, the hilum area (although the entire surface of seeds is covered with a clinging dust coating of inoculant).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Suitable active ingredients may be used in the seed coating applied to the seeds. An inoculant may include soil or plant inoculants shall include any carrier or culture of a specific micro-organism or mixture of micro-organisms represented to improve the soil or the growth, quality, or yield of plants, and also any seed or fertilizer represented to be inoculated with such a culture. Inoculants may include substances manufactured, sold or represented for use in the improvement of the physical condition of the soil or to aid plant growth or crop yields. Inoculants may include a formulation containing pure or predetermined mixtures of living bacteria, fungi or virus particles for the treatment of seed, seedlings or other plant propagation material for the purpose of enhancing the growth capabilities or disease resistance or otherwise altering the properties of the eventual plants or crop. Inoculants may include any chemical or biological substance of mixture of substances or device distributed in this state to be applied to soil, plants or seeds for soil corrective purposes; or which is intended to improve germination, growth, quality, yield, product quality, reproduction, flavor, or other desirable characteristics of plants or which is intended to produce any chemical, biochemical, biological or physical change in soil.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Various microorganisms may be used as active ingredients. In some cases, <i>Rhizobium </i>(including <i>Bradyrhizobium</i>), <i>Pseudomonas, Serratia, Bacillus, Pasteuria, Azotobacter, Enterobacter, Azospirillum, Cyanobacteria, Gliocladium, Trichoderma, Coniotherium, Verticillium, Paecilomyces, Metarhizium, </i>mycorrhizal fungi and entomophilic nematodes may be used. Many microorganisms are known to exert beneficial effects on plant growth. Among these are the nitrogen-fixing Rhizobium species, which are symbionts of leguminous species. Azospirillum species, which are free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated with the roots of grasses, are also now recognized for their plant growth-promoting qualities. Certain microorganisms may function in a number of ways to improve growth of the plants, to improve N and P status of plants or to control certain pests and diseases which affect plants. These organisms include bacteria of the genera <i>Rhizobium </i>(including <i>Bradyrhizobium</i>), <i>Pseudomonas, Serratia, Bacillus, Pasteuria, Azobacter, Enterobacter, Azospirillum, </i>and <i>Cyanobacteria, </i>(blue-green algae), fungi of the genera <i>Gliocladium, Trichoderma, Coniotherium, Verticillium, Paecilomyces, Metarhizium, </i>and mycorrhizal fungi, and entomophilic nematodes when present in the soil in the vicinity of the roots of particular plants. Certain thiazolylisoxazolines may be used as fungicides. After bacteria has been added, a small quantity of nutrient material (e.g., monoor di-saccharides such as sucrose, glucose, etc.) may be added to the active bacteria at this stage. Quantities of nutrient material sufficient to approximately equal the weight of the bacteria in the dormant state, or even larger quantities, may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Various suitable seed coating machines and methods may be used. In some cases, a coating fluid may be applied whereby seeds are dispersed with a seed dispersing member. In some cases, a process may be used for dressing seed in which seed is guided over a dispensing cone through a jet of dressing and onto a rotary table. In some cases, a mixing bowl may be connected to a high speed, multi-turn actuator and a mechanism to feed seed into the mixing bowl. The bowl rotates to rotate seed being treated therein. The seed treating formulation is sprayed in the bowl while the seed is being rotated to uniformly coat the seed with the formulation. In some cases, a rotating brush may be used for dispensing the fluid. The brush may receive fluid that is hurled outwardly from the brush fibers by the centrifugal force provided by the rotation. In some cases, a rotating plate may be used for dispensing the fluid. The fluid may be poured on the plate and hurled outwardly by centrifugal force. Flutes may be included in the plate to increase the vertical distance in which droplets are hurled outwardly. In some cases, a drying mechanism may be used with a hot air feed that can reduce drying time as compared to a coating device without a hot air feed. In some cases, a mixer may include an open bottom for dispersing seed. In some cases, knives, scrapers or buffers of various shapes may be inserted in a mixing vessel in order to prevent the products to be coated from turning with the vessel. A suitable coating vessel may be of various shapes. Vessels of a spherical, cylindrical, ellipsoidal, flattened spherical, rectangular, polygonal or other shapes may be employed. The coating vessel may have a flat bottom and a side wall that are joined to each other by a fillet radius in order to make it easier to set the products to be coated in rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The nature of the materials used to construct the coating vessels may depend on their use. Thus, coating vessels may be made of a metal such as stainless steel, of plastic or any other suitable material. In addition, the inner wall of the vessel may have been subjected to various treatments such as, in particular, a nonstick treatment such as, for example, a coating with polymers such as polyvinylidene fluoride. Preferably the interior of the vessel should have only rounded corners.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Coating substances may be used that are in the form of powders, uniformly sprayed into the coating vessel during its rotation and to spray, using a gun, a binder or an adhesive which bonds the powder(s) to the products to be coated. Several growth-promoting mechanisms are known, which may influence the plant in a direct or indirect manner.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The systems and methods disclosed here may be used for the coating of suitable seeds, for example peanuts, and other large granular seeds will work, such as corn, soybean, peas, large diameter seeds. In some cases, the systems and methods create coated seeds that have an evenly applied coating, as uneven application of active agents may negatively affect germination rate. Suitable connections between parts may be used, such as hinges (including living and other hinges), connections through other parts using fasteners, using welding, adhesives, riveting, or other methods. Connections between parts stated to be at a particular location may be at or near that location unless context dictates otherwise. Various relative words are intended to be relative and not restricted to absolute values unless context dictates otherwise, for example front, rear, side, up, down, top, base, vertical, and horizontal are examples of words that are not to be taken absolutely unless context dictates otherwise. A hopper includes a device that can supply a product to another device. Suitable actuators may be used, such as hydraulic, screw, linear, or other actuators. A suitable controller may include one or more of a processor, a user interface such as a keyboard, a display, and a network connection.
