<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 16/745,341, filed on Jan. 17, 2020, which claims priority to EP Application No. 19155207, filed on Feb. 4, 2019, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?>
<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to working rollers of an agricultural device which are asymmetric in terms of the construction and the number of discs. Agricultural devices with operating units for soil processing (e.g., ploughshares) should be arranged so that each operating unit mounted to the supporting frame of the agricultural device corresponds with exactly one disc of the front part of the roller, or the disc and the operating unit are located in the same plane. Seeds are put into a freshly ploughed furrow created by the operating units and are slightly pushed into the soil by the subsequent overrun of the discs. The remaining discs located on the rear part of the roller without a corresponding operating unit then run over the created furrow and level the piled-up soil. Thanks to this processing, suitable placement of seeds in the soil, their pushing and covering by freshly processed soil is ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The agricultural devices with a narrow operating width, which do not need to be folded in order to meet the standard width requirements for transport of an agricultural device on roads, use a single continuous working roller divided into a front part and a rear part, wherein this roller is attached to the device frame, thus this device performs its function completely, or the soil is evenly processed along the whole width of the agricultural device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With wider operating width, the agricultural device in its unfolded state cannot be transported on roads and it is necessary to divide the structure frame into a central part and a left wing and a right wing, wherein these wings are rotatably attached to the central part to allow folding of the whole structure. Therefore, it is necessary to use at least two rear rollers, wherein the left rear roller is mounted to the left wing of the structure and the right rear roller is mounted to the right wing of the structure. However, using this structure, a gap in which no disc is located appears in between the rollers, therefore the discs are not arranged in regular distances along the whole operating width of the agricultural device. In the place with a missing disc, the soil is improperly processed, which leads to poor growth of crops in this place (i.e., economic losses in the long term). This structural deficiency can be found in the document DE102016115319 A1, in which two sets of rollers (reference sign 40) are located in the rear part of the agricultural device. There is a gap between the discs, between the left set of rollers and the right set of rollers, which fails to correspond with the distance interval between other discs.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there exists a need for an agricultural device in which the rear rollers are provided with discs and arranged in such way that soil is evenly processed along the whole operating width of the agricultural device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The above-mentioned drawbacks are, at least partially, eliminated by an agricultural device for soil processing having two sets of working rollers comprising a supporting frame which comprises a central part, a left wing and a right wing, wherein the left and right wing are rotatably connected to the central part, at least two sets of working units mounted to the supporting frame, wherein in every row, the working units are arranged in regular distances, the left set of rollers mounted to the left wing and the right set of rollers mounted to the right wing, wherein the sets are divided into a front roller and a rear roller and provided with attachments and discs located between these attachments, wherein the discs of the front rollers are located in the same plane as the working units. The number of discs of the rear rollers differs from the number of discs of the front rollers exactly by one disc and the distances between individual discs are the same along the whole width of the agricultural device.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The agricultural device is designed in such a way that the left set of rollers and the right set of rollers have different number of discs and different length. The sets of rollers are provided with attachments, between which the discs are located. One set of rollers is provided with a disc that is located on the inner side of the attachment, wherein the distance of this disc from the nearest discs corresponds with the distance between discs. This disc can be part of the front roller of the right set of rollers, or the front roller of the left set of rollers, or the rear roller of the right set of rollers, or the rear roller of the left set of rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a preferred embodiment, the total number of discs is thirty-nine and working units nineteen. A working unit can be a ploughshare or a chisel and the agricultural device is provided with three rows of working units.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In a preferred embodiment, the agricultural device is then provided with at least one wheel that makes the transport of the agricultural device easier on roads.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The agricultural device <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref> comprises a supporting frame <b>2</b>, which is further divided into a central part <b>3</b>, a left wing <b>4</b> and a right wing <b>5</b>, wherein the wings <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> are rotatably attached to the central part <b>3</b>. Because of the rotatable mounting it is possible to fold the agricultural device <b>1</b> into a more compact form, which is important for subsequent transport of the agricultural device <b>1</b> on roads. The agricultural device <b>1</b> includes at least two rows <b>6</b> of working units <b>7</b>, which are arranged in such a way that their mutual distance <b>14</b> is the same along the whole width of the agricultural device <b>1</b>. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the agricultural device is provided with three rows <b>6</b> of working units <b>7</b>. However, even multi-row arrangements with four, five and more sets <b>6</b> of working units <b>7</b> are possible. In an exemplary embodiment of the invention, the working unit <b>7</b> is a ploughshare, although other embodiments of the invention are possible with different working units <b>7</b> that are used for soil processing, e.g. by chisels.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Agricultural device <b>1</b> is further provided with two sets of rollers shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b>-<b>11</b></figref>, namely the left set of rollers <b>9</b> and the right set of rollers <b>10</b>, wherein the left set of rollers <b>9</b> is considered to be the left set from the top view of the device <b>1</b> in the driving direction <b>1</b><i>a </i>and the right set of rollers <b>10</b> is considered to be the right set of rollers from the top view of the device <b>1</b> in the driving direction <b>1</b><i>a, </i>see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The left set of rollers <b>9</b> is attached to the left wing <b>4</b> and the right set of rollers <b>10</b> is attached to the right wing <b>5</b>. The sets of rollers <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> are divided into the front roller <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>a, </i>the rear roller <b>9</b><i>b </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>and they are provided with attachments <b>13</b> along their sides, where the inner attachments <b>13</b><i>a </i>are located closer to the center of the agricultural device <b>1</b> and the outer attachments <b>13</b><i>b </i>are located further from the center of the agricultural device <b>1</b>. The discs <b>11</b> are arranged between the attachments <b>13</b> of the rollers in such a way that the position of the discs <b>11</b><i>a </i>located on front rollers <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>a </i>correspond with the working units <b>7</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The number of discs <b>11</b><i>b </i>located on rear rollers <b>9</b><i>b </i>and <b>10</b><i>b </i>differs by exactly one disc <b>11</b> from the number of discs <b>11</b><i>a </i>located on front rollers <b>9</b><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>a, </i>and they are located in such way that the mutual distance <b>12</b> of all discs <b>11</b> is the same along the whole width of the agricultural device <b>1</b>.
