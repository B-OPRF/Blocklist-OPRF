<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to agricultural implement and more particularly an end wheel assembly for an agricultural implement to transform the agricultural implement between a transport position and an operating position.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Agricultural implements, such as land rollers, are pulled behind a tractor or other tow vehicle to perform an agricultural function in a field. In the case of a land roller, the land roller is used to compact the soil and press stones into the field to create a flat field surface and to increase the soil density in the field before or after a crop is planted in the field.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">These agricultural implements are typically of a substantial size because the wider the working path of the implement as it is pulled through a field, the more surface area of the field that can be covered with each pass of the tow vehicle and implement. However, when the implement is to be transported to another field, often down a roadway, this width of the implement is a problem because a wide implement is harder to transport and the implement has to be narrow enough to fit on the roadway. These implements often have a first wing section and a second wing section containing the soil tools, such as rollers for a land roller. These wing sections can be pivoted into a field position, with the wing sections positioned perpendicular to a travel direction of the agricultural implement when the agricultural implement is to be pulled through a field in order to increase the width of the implement. The wing sections can also be pivoted into a transport position, with the wing sections pivoted parallel to the travel direction of the agricultural implement so that the width of the agricultural implement is reduced when the agricultural implement is to be transported to another field.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To convert the implement from a transport position to a field position, and vice versa, can be difficult and require a number of components.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates an agricultural implement <b>10</b> that is typically towed behind a tractor or other tow vehicle in an agricultural field. Implement <b>10</b> is shown as a land roller with rollers <b>22</b>, <b>42</b>, and <b>62</b> for flattening a field to create a smoother surface for spraying, harvesting, etc. and to increase the soil density of the field before or after planting a crop. The implement <b>10</b> can have a center section <b>20</b>, a first wing section <b>40</b>, and a second wing section <b>60</b>. The first wing section <b>40</b> can be pivotally connected at a first end <b>44</b> to the center section <b>20</b> and the second wing section <b>60</b> can be pivotally connected at a first <b>64</b> to the center section <b>20</b>. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates the implement <b>10</b> as a land roller, the implement could be any agricultural implement with a pair of wing sections where soil tools are provided on the wing sections. If the implement <b>10</b> is a land roller, the center section <b>20</b> can be provided with a center roller <b>22</b>, the first wing section <b>40</b> can be provided with a first wing roller <b>42</b>, and the second wing section <b>60</b> can be provided with a second wing roller <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Ground wheels <b>32</b> can be provided attached to the center section <b>20</b> and vertically moveable, with an actuator, such as a hydraulic cylinder, so that the ground wheels <b>32</b> can be moved downwards to lift the center section <b>20</b>, and the center roller <b>22</b>, if the implement is a land roller, off of the ground surface for transport of the implement <b>10</b> and the ground wheels <b>32</b> can be moved upwards to lower the center section <b>20</b> relative to the ground surface.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A first end wheel assembly <b>100</b>A can be provided at a second end <b>46</b> of the first wing section <b>40</b> and a second end wheel assembly <b>100</b>B can be provided at a second end <b>66</b> of the second wing section <b>60</b>. The first end wheel assembly <b>100</b>A and the second end wheel assembly <b>100</b>B can have end wheels <b>105</b></p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A hitch assembly <b>80</b> can be provided attached to the center section <b>20</b> to hitch the implement <b>10</b> to a tow vehicle (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>, the implement <b>10</b> can be hitched to a tow vehicle <b>2</b>, such as a tractor, and towed in a travel direction T of the implement <b>10</b>. The implement <b>10</b> can be converted between a field position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, and a transport position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> shows the implement <b>10</b> in the midst of being transformed from the transport position into the field position. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, in the field position the first wing section <b>40</b> and the second wing section <b>60</b> are pivoted forward to be positioned substantially perpendicular to the travel direction T of the implement <b>10</b>. This allows the center section <b>20</b>, the first wing section <b>40</b> and the second wing section <b>60</b> to cover a wide swath of field as the implement <b>10</b> is pulled through the field by a tow vehicle <b>2</b>. When the implement <b>10</b> is in the field position, the end wheels <b>105</b> in the end wheel assemblies <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B can be in their up position so they are not supporting the first wing section <b>40</b> and the second wing section <b>60</b> and the first wing roller <b>42</b> and the second wing roller <b>62</b> are resting on the ground surface. The ground wheels <b>32</b> can also be moved vertically upwards so the ground wheels <b>32</b> are not supporting the center section <b>20</b> off the ground surface and center roller <b>22</b> is resting on the ground surface.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">When the implement <b>10</b> is to be pulled to another location or field, such as when the implement <b>10</b> is to be transported down a roadway, the implement <b>10</b> can be put in the transport position. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, in the transport position the first wing section <b>40</b> and the second wing section <b>60</b> can be pivoted backwards behind the center section <b>20</b> with the first wing section <b>40</b> and the second wing section <b>60</b> positioned substantially parallel to the travel direction T of the implement <b>10</b>. The end wheel assemblies <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B can be positioned with their end wheels <b>105</b> in their down position so that the end wheel assembly <b>100</b>A is supporting the first wing section <b>40</b> above the ground surface and the end wheel assembly <b>100</b>B is supporting the second wing section <b>60</b> above the ground surface. The grounds wheels <b>32</b> can also be place in their down positions so that the center section <b>20</b>, the first wing section <b>40</b> and the second wing section <b>60</b> are all positioned above the ground surface.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">To transform the implement <b>10</b> from the field position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, to the transport position, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, positioning members <b>26</b> connected between the center section <b>20</b> and the first wing section <b>40</b> and the second wing section <b>60</b>, respectively, can be disconnected. These positioning members <b>26</b> are used when the implement <b>10</b> is in the field position to prevent the first wing section <b>40</b> and the second wing section <b>60</b> from pivoting around their first ends <b>44</b>, <b>46</b> and keeping the first wing section <b>40</b> and the second wing section <b>60</b> positioned substantially perpendicular to the travel direction T of the implement <b>10</b>. When the positioning members <b>26</b> are disconnected, the first wing section <b>40</b> and the second wing section <b>60</b> are free to pivot around their first ends <b>44</b>, <b>64</b>, so that the tow vehicle <b>2</b> simply has to drive forwards in the travel direction T for the wing sections <b>40</b>, <b>60</b> to pivot from their field position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, to the transport position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, with the wing section <b>40</b>, <b>60</b> substantially parallel to the travel direction T of the implement <b>10</b>. The end wheels <b>32</b> and the end wheels assemblies <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B can all be lowered so that the center section <b>20</b>, the first wing section <b>40</b> and the second wing section <b>60</b> are all supported above the ground surface and the implement <b>10</b> can be easily towed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">While the implement <b>10</b> can be transformed from the field position to the transport position by simply disconnecting the positioning members <b>26</b> and pulling the implement <b>10</b> forwards in the travel direction T, it is not so straightforward to transform the implement <b>10</b> from the transport position to the field position. When the implement <b>10</b> is in the transport position, the end wheels <b>105</b> on the end wheel assemblies <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B must be positioned so that the end wheels <b>105</b> are pointed in the travel direction T of the implement <b>10</b> so that the implement <b>10</b> can be towed in the travel direction T and the first wing section <b>40</b> and the second wing section <b>60</b> will remain substantially parallel to one another. However, to transform the implement <b>10</b> from the transport position to the field position, the end wheels <b>105</b> of the end wheels assemblies <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B have to be angled so that the end wheels <b>105</b> are toed out when the implement <b>10</b> is being reversed in a direction opposite to the travel direction T. In this manner, with the toed out end wheels <b>105</b> on the end wheel assemblies <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B, the reversing of the implement <b>10</b> in a direction opposite the travel direction T will cause the second end <b>46</b> of the first wing section <b>40</b> and the second end <b>66</b> of the second wing section <b>60</b> to move outwards from the travel direction T as the implement <b>10</b> is reversed because the second ends <b>46</b>, <b>66</b> will be following the direction the end wheels <b>105</b> of the end wheels assemblies <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B are pointed. This will cause the second end <b>46</b> of the first wing section <b>40</b> and the second end <b>66</b> of the second wing section <b>60</b> to move apart from one another, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The implement <b>10</b> can continued to be backed up in a direction opposite the travel direction T until the first wing section <b>40</b> and the second wing section <b>60</b> are substantially perpendicular to the travel direction T and the implement <b>10</b> is in the field position.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">When first wing section <b>40</b> and the second wing section <b>60</b> are substantially perpendicular to the travel direction T, the end wheels <b>105</b> on the end wheel assemblies <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B can be raised and the positioning members <b>26</b> used to connect the center section <b>20</b> to the first wing section <b>40</b> and the second wing section <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The end wheel assemblies <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B are attached at second end <b>46</b> of the first wing section <b>40</b> and the second end <b>66</b> of the second wing section <b>60</b>, respectively, and can be transformed between the field position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> shows end wheel assembly <b>100</b>B in the field position), a transport position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, and an unfolding position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>, in the field position, end wheel assembly <b>100</b>B is pivoted upwards so that the end wheel <b>105</b> is lifted up and off the ground surface and the second wing roller <b>62</b> is resting on the ground surface. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, in the transport position, the end wheel assemblies <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B are pivoted downwards so that the ends wheels <b>105</b> are positioned down and in contact with the ground surface and the first wing roller <b>42</b> and the second wing roller <b>62</b> is lifted off of the ground surface.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The end wheel assemblies <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B can also be placed in an unfolding position where the end wheels <b>105</b> of the end wheel assemblies <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B where the end wheels <b>105</b> are raised slightly causing the end wheel assemblies <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B to angle the end wheels <b>105</b> outwards. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the end wheel assembly <b>100</b>B is in an unfolding position where the end wheel <b>105</b> of the end wheel assembly <b>100</b>B is in contact with the ground surface, but the end wheel <b>105</b> is raised slightly causing the end wheel assembly <b>100</b>B to angle the end wheel <b>105</b> outwards so that when the implement <b>10</b> is backed up the outward-pointing end wheel <b>105</b> causes the second end <b>66</b> of the second wing section <b>60</b> to move outwards from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>10</b></figref> illustrates an end wheel assembly <b>100</b> for use in transforming the implement <b>10</b> between the transport position and the field position.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>9</b> and <b>10</b></figref>, the biasing device <b>150</b> can be operatively connected between the wheel bracket <b>110</b> and one of the brackets <b>130</b>B (or the wheel member <b>120</b>) to create a rotational biasing force on the wheel bracket <b>110</b> (and therefore the ground wheel <b>105</b>) to pivot the wheel bracket <b>110</b> around the axis B and prevent the ground wheel <b>105</b> and the wheel bracket <b>110</b> from rotating freely. This biasing device <b>150</b> can pretension the end wheel <b>105</b> to prevent movement of the end wheel <b>105</b> when the wheel assembly <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B is in the field position and the end wheel <b>105</b> is pivoted upwards off of the ground surface.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In one aspect, the biasing device <b>150</b> can have a shaft <b>151</b> connected to the attachment brackets <b>130</b>B, a biasing bracket <b>152</b> with an aperture <b>153</b> through which the shaft passes through; a spring <b>155</b> such as a compression spring; and a stopping element <b>156</b>. The spring <b>155</b> can be positioned around the shaft <b>151</b> with one end of the spring <b>155</b> seated against the biasing bracket <b>152</b> and another end of the spring <b>155</b> seated against the stopping element <b>156</b> on an end of the shaft <b>151</b>.

The implement frame <b>200</b> could be the frame of the first wing section <b>20</b> or the frame of the second wing section <b>40</b> depending on which wing section the end wheel assembly is attached to.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The guide plate <b>160</b> can be connected between the wheel member <b>120</b> and the wheel pivot <b>110</b> with the channel <b>162</b> in the guide plate <b>160</b> opening towards the implement frame. A first end <b>164</b> of the guide plate <b>160</b> can be connected to the wheel member <b>120</b> and a second end <b>166</b> of the guide plate <b>160</b> can be connected to the wheel pivot <b>110</b> by a spherical bearing <b>168</b> so that the guide plate <b>160</b> can remain straight while the wheel pivot <b>110</b> may be angled relative to the guide plate <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the channel <b>162</b> can have an open end <b>170</b> and a terminating end <b>172</b> with the channel <b>162</b> being directed generally upwards as the channel <b>162</b> extends from the terminating end <b>172</b> to the open end <b>170</b>. An angled entry <b>174</b> can be provided at the open end <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> a positioning bracket <b>146</b> holding a rounded positioning member <b>148</b> can be provided extending from the second end <b>66</b> of the second wing section <b>60</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>11</b></figref>, the positioning bracket <b>146</b> positions the positioning member <b>148</b> relative to the guide plate <b>160</b> so that when the end wheel assembly <b>100</b>B is pivoted downwards, the positioning member <b>148</b> comes into contact with the angle entry <b>174</b> on the guide plate <b>160</b>. Further pivoting downwards of the end wheel assembly <b>100</b>A forces the angled entry <b>174</b> against the positioning member <b>148</b>, causing the guide plate <b>160</b> to rotate so the positioning member <b>148</b> can enter the channel <b>162</b> in the guide plate <b>160</b>. The positioning member <b>148</b>, secured to the second end <b>66</b> of the second wing frame <b>60</b> by the positioning bracket <b>146</b>, can travel through the channel <b>162</b> in the guide plate <b>160</b> from the open end <b>170</b> of the channel <b>162</b> to the terminating end <b>172</b> of the channel <b>162</b> as the end wheel assembly <b>100</b>B continues to be pivoted downwards around axis C.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A similar positioning bracket and member can be provided on the second end <b>46</b> of the first wing section <b>40</b> to receive the channel <b>170</b> on the guide plate <b>160</b> of the end wheel assembly <b>100</b>A is pivoted downwards.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, when the end wheel assembly <b>100</b>B is pivoted downwards so that the positioning member <b>148</b> comes into contact with the angled entry <b>174</b>, the positioning member <b>148</b>, securely fixed in place by the positioning bracket <b>146</b>, will force the guide plate <b>160</b> to rotate in order to accommodate the unmoving positioning member <b>148</b>. The first end <b>164</b> of the guide plate <b>160</b> is connected to the wheel member <b>120</b> which remains fixed in place on the end wheel assembly <b>100</b>B so the guide plate <b>160</b> will be rotated downwards by the positioning member <b>148</b> being forced against the angled entry <b>174</b> around its first end <b>165</b>. This rotation of the guide plate <b>160</b> around the first end <b>164</b> of the guide plate <b>160</b> will cause the second end <b>166</b> of the guide plate <b>160</b> to rotate the wheel pivot <b>110</b>, the second end <b>166</b> is attached to, around the axis B and relative to the wheel member <b>120</b>. The rotation of the wheel pivot <b>110</b> will, in turn, rotate the end wheel <b>105</b> around the axis B. The use of the spherical bearing <b>166</b> allows the second end <b>166</b> of the guide plate <b>160</b> to have motion (or play) relative to the wheel pivot <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As the downward rotation of the guide plate <b>160</b> forces the wheel pivot <b>110</b> and the end wheel <b>105</b> to rotate around axis B, the end wheel <b>105</b> will turn outwards from a centerline CL of the implement frame <b>200</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, this rotation or turning out of the wheel pivot <b>110</b> and the end wheel <b>105</b> will cause the direction of the end wheel <b>105</b> to be angled relative to the centerline CL of the implement frame <b>200</b> so that the end wheel is turned outwards from the center CL of the implement frame <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the downward direction of the channel <b>162</b> from the open end <b>170</b> to the terminating end <b>172</b> causes the positioning member <b>148</b> to rotate the guide plate <b>160</b> back upwards, in a direction opposite to the direction that the angled entry <b>174</b> caused the guide plate <b>160</b> to rotate in. This rotating of the guide plate <b>16</b> in the opposite direction will cause the wheel pivot <b>110</b> and the end wheel <b>105</b> to rotate in the opposite direction around axis B so that the ground wheel <b>105</b> is turned back towards a direction parallel the centerline CL of the implement frame <b>200</b>. When the end wheel assembly <b>100</b> is in the fully down position, the positioning member <b>148</b> will have reached the terminating end <b>172</b> of the channel <b>162</b> in the guide plate <b>160</b> and the end wheel <b>105</b> will again be pointing in direction parallel to the centerline CL of the implement frame <b>200</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In operation, with the implement <b>10</b> in the transport position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the implement <b>10</b> can be transformed into the field position by using the wheel actuators <b>142</b> to partially raise the end wheel assemblies <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B which will rotate the end wheels <b>105</b> outwards so that the end wheels <b>105</b> are angled outwards from the travel direction T of the implement <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the end wheel assembly <b>100</b> is in the transport position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the end wheel <b>105</b> will be pointing in a direction parallel to the centerline CL and the positioning member <b>148</b> will be positioned against the terminating end <b>172</b> of the channel <b>162</b> in the guide plate <b>160</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>10</b></figref>, when the end wheel assembly <b>100</b> is pivoted around axis C, the positioning member <b>148</b> will travel along the channel <b>162</b> in the guide plate <b>160</b> from the terminating end <b>172</b> to the open end <b>170</b>. Because of the upward direction of the channel <b>162</b> as it runs from its terminating end <b>172</b> to its open end <b>170</b>, as the positioning member <b>148</b> travels along this channel <b>162</b> the guide plate <b>160</b> will rotate downwards because of the force of the positioning member <b>148</b> against the bottom of the channel <b>162</b> since the positioning member <b>148</b> is fixed in place by the positioning bracket <b>146</b>. The rotation downwards of the guide plate <b>160</b> will cause the guide plate <b>160</b> to rotate around the first end <b>164</b> of the guide plate <b>160</b> which is attached to the wheel member <b>120</b>, while the second end <b>166</b> of the guide plate <b>160</b>, which is attached to the wheel pivot <b>110</b> by the spherical bearing <b>168</b>, will rotate the wheel pivot <b>110</b> and therefore the end wheel <b>105</b> around axis B. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, this will cause the ground wheel <b>105</b> to be angled outwards from the centerline CL of the implement frame <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, with the end wheels <b>105</b> angled outwards, the tow vehicle <b>2</b> can be used to back up the implement <b>10</b> in a direction opposite to the travel direction T. The outward angling of the end wheels <b>105</b> at the ends <b>46</b>, <b>66</b> of the wing sections <b>40</b>, <b>60</b> will cause the ends <b>46</b>, <b>66</b> of the wing sections <b>40</b>, <b>60</b> to follow the direction of the end wheels <b>105</b> causing the ends <b>46</b>, <b>66</b> to move outwards and apart from one another as the wing sections <b>40</b>, <b>60</b> rotate around their first ends <b>44</b>, <b>64</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The implement <b>10</b> can continue to be backed up by the tow vehicle <b>2</b> until the first wing section <b>40</b> and the second wing section <b>60</b> are position substantially perpendicular to the travel direction T of the implement <b>10</b>. When the wing sections <b>40</b>, <b>60</b> reach this point, the tow vehicle <b>2</b> can stop backing up the implement <b>10</b> and the positioning members <b>26</b> can be used to secure the wing sections <b>40</b>, <b>60</b> in this position. The wheel actuators <b>142</b> can then be used to fully raise the end wheel assemblies <b>100</b>A, <b>100</b>B so the end wheels <b>105</b> are raised above the ground surface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>.
