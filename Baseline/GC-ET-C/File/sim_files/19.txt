<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure generally relates to work vehicles, such as agricultural vehicles or construction vehicles, and, more particularly, to systems and methods for generating swath lines for a work vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Modern farming practices strive to increase yields of agricultural fields. As such, agricultural work vehicles, such as tractors, sprayers, harvesters, and/or the like, are used to perform agricultural operations on a field. In general, when performing an agricultural operation, it is necessary for the work vehicle to make a series of passes across the field. However, it is difficult for an operator to control the work vehicle such that passes are consistent and uniformly spaced apart. Inconsistent or non-uniformly spaced passes may result in lower crop yields and/or inefficient performance of the agricultural operation. In this respect, systems have been developed for generating swath lines or guidance lines for guiding a work vehicle along each pass across the field. While such systems work well, further improvements are needed. For example, in certain instances, the swath lines may need to be adjusted after generation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Accordingly, an improved system and method for adjusting swath lines for a work vehicle would be welcomed in the technology.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Reference now will be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In general, the present subject matter is directed to a system and a method for adjusting swath lines for a work vehicle. As will be described below, the work vehicle includes one or more operating parameter sensors. Each operating parameter sensor, in turn, is configured to capture data indicative of an operating parameter of the work vehicle. For example, the operating parameter(s) may include a vehicle dynamics parameter(s), such as a turning radius of the vehicle, a slew rate of vehicle and an associated implement, and/or a slip of the vehicle. Furthermore, the operating parameter(s) may include a loading parameter(s) of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In several embodiments, a computing system of the disclosed system is configured to adjust a swath line being used to guide the work vehicle across a field based on one or more operating parameters of the vehicle. Specifically, in such embodiments, the computing system is configured to access a swath line corresponding to a pass to be made across a field by the vehicle. For example, the computing system may access a swath line that was generated during a previous operation on the field. Additionally, the computing system is configured to control the operation of the work vehicle such that the work vehicle travels along the accessed swath line to make the pass across the field. Moreover, as the work vehicle travels along the swath line, the computing system is configured to receive the data captured by the operating parameter sensor(s) and determine the operating parameter(s) of the work vehicle based on the received data. Thereafter, as the work vehicle travels along the swath line, the computing system is configured to adjust a portion of the swath line positioned forward of the work vehicle based on the determined operating parameter(s).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Adjusting a swath line used to guide a work vehicle across a field based on an operating parameter(s) of the vehicle determined as the vehicle travels across the field improves the operation of the vehicle. More specifically, as a work vehicle travels across a field, field conditions and/or its loading may affect its performance. As such, in certain instances, the vehicle may be unable to follow the swath line being used to guide the vehicle. For example, the minimum turning radius of a vehicle may be greater in muddy field conditions than in dry field conditions. In this respect, by adjusting the swath line (e.g., by increasing the radius of its curved portions) based on a monitored operating parameter(s), the disclosed system and method ensure that the work vehicle can traverse the swath line as field conditions vary.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition, the same field conditions may affect different vehicles differently. For example, the turning radius of one work vehicle may be more impacted by the same muddy conditions than another work vehicle. Furthermore, differing vehicle loading may cause the same field conditions to affect a vehicle differently. Thus, by relying on operating parameters of the vehicle (e.g., vehicle dynamics and/or loading parameter(s)) as opposed to field condition data, the disclosed system and method ensure different work vehicles and vehicles of varying loads can traverse the swath line.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of a work vehicle <b>10</b> towing an associated agricultural implement <b>12</b> across a field in a direction of travel (indicated by arrow <b>14</b>). In the illustrated embodiment, the work vehicle <b>10</b> is configured as an agricultural vehicle (e.g., an agricultural tractor) and the agricultural implement <b>12</b> is configured as a tillage implement (e.g., a disk ripper). However, in alternative embodiments, the work vehicle <b>10</b> may correspond to any other suitable type of agricultural vehicle (e.g., an agricultural harvester, a self-propelled sprayer, etc.) or construction vehicle (e.g., a dozer, a grader, a loader, etc.) and the agricultural implement <b>12</b> may correspond to any other suitable type of agricultural implement (e.g., a seed-planting implement, a towable sprayer, etc.). Additionally, in some embodiments, the vehicle <b>10</b> may not be configured to tow an implement.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in FIG, <b>1</b>, the vehicle <b>10</b> includes a pair of front track assemblies <b>16</b>, a pair of rear track assemblies <b>18</b>, and a frame or chassis <b>20</b> coupled to and supported by the track assemblies <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. An operator's cab <b>22</b> may be supported by a portion of the chassis <b>20</b> and may house various input devices for permitting an operator to control the operation of one or more components of the vehicle <b>10</b> and/or one or more components of the implement <b>12</b>. Furthermore, the vehicle <b>10</b> may include an engine <b>102</b> and a transmission <b>104</b> mounted on the chassis <b>20</b>. The transmission <b>104</b> may be operably coupled to the engine <b>102</b> and may provide variably adjusted gear ratios for transferring engine power to the track assemblies <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> via a drive axle assembly (not shown) (or via axles if multiple drive axles are employed).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the implement <b>12</b> includes a frame <b>24</b>. More specifically, the frame <b>24</b> generally includes a plurality of structural frame members <b>26</b>, such as beams, bars, and/or the like, which are configured to support or couple to a plurality of components. For example, as will be described below, the frame <b>24</b> may be configured to support one or more ground-engaging tools configured to perform an agricultural operation on a field as the implement <b>12</b> travels across the field. Furthermore, a hitch assembly <b>28</b> may be connected to the frame <b>24</b> and configured to couple the implement <b>12</b> to the vehicle <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In several embodiments, the frame <b>24</b> may support one or more gangs or sets of disk blades <b>30</b>. Each disk blade <b>30</b> may, in turn, be configured to penetrate into or otherwise engage the soil as the implement <b>12</b> is pulled through the field. In this regard, the various gangs of disk blades <b>30</b> may be oriented at an angle relative to the direction of travel <b>14</b> to promote more effective tilling of the soil. In the embodiment shown in FIG, <b>1</b>, the implement <b>12</b> includes four gangs of disk blades <b>30</b> supported on the frame <b>24</b> adjacent to its forward end. However, in alternative embodiments, the implement <b>12</b> may include any other suitable number of gangs. Furthermore, in one embodiment, the gangs of disk blades <b>30</b> may be mounted to the frame <b>24</b> at any other suitable location, such as adjacent to its aft end.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Moreover, in several embodiments, the implement frame <b>24</b> may be configured to support other ground-engaging tools. For instance, in the illustrated embodiment, the frame <b>24</b> is configured to support a plurality of shanks <b>32</b>. As shown, the shanks <b>32</b> are spaced apart from each other on the frame <b>24</b> in a lateral direction of the implement <b>12</b>. The lateral direction, in turn, extends perpendicular to the direction of travel <b>14</b>. As such, the shanks <b>32</b> are configured to rip or otherwise till the soil as the implement <b>12</b> is towed across the field. Furthermore, in the illustrated embodiment, the frame <b>24</b> is also configured to support a plurality of leveling blades <b>34</b> and a plurality of rolling (or crumbler) basket assemblies <b>36</b> positioned aft of the shanks <b>32</b>. In such an embodiment, the leveling blades <b>34</b> may be spaced apart from each other in the lateral direction. However, in other embodiments, any other suitable ground-engaging tools may be coupled to and supported by the implement frame <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The configuration of the work vehicle <b>10</b> and the associated agricultural implement <b>12</b> described above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is provided only to place the present subject matter in an exemplary field of use. Thus, the present subject matter may be readily adaptable to any manner of work vehicle and/or implement configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a schematic view of one embodiment of a system <b>100</b> for adjusting swath lines for a work vehicle is illustrated in accordance with aspects of the present subject matter. In general, the system <b>100</b> will be described herein with reference to the work vehicle <b>10</b> and the agricultural implement <b>12</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. However, the disclosed system <b>100</b> may generally be used with work vehicles having any other suitable vehicle configuration and/or agricultural implements having any other suitable implement configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the system <b>100</b> includes one or more components of the work vehicle <b>10</b>. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the system <b>100</b> includes the engine <b>102</b> and the transmission <b>104</b> of the work vehicle <b>10</b>. Additionally, in the illustrated embodiment, the system <b>100</b> includes one or more braking actuators <b>106</b> of the vehicle <b>10</b>. In general, when activated, the braking actuator(s) <b>106</b> may reduce the speed at which the vehicle/implement <b>10</b>/<b>12</b> moves across the field, such as by converting energy associated with the movement of the vehicle; implement <b>10</b>/<b>12</b> into heat. For example, in one embodiment, the braking actuator(s) <b>106</b> may correspond to a suitable hydraulic cylinder(s) configured to push a stationary frictional element(s) (not shown), such as a brake shoe(s) or a brake caliper(s), against a rotating element(s) (not shown), such as a brake drum(s) or a brake disk(s). However, in alternative embodiments, the braking actuator(s) <b>106</b> may any other suitable hydraulic, pneumatic, mechanical, and/or electrical component(s) configured to convert the rotation of the rotating element(s) into heat.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, in several embodiments, the system <b>100</b> may include a steering actuator <b>108</b> of the work vehicle <b>10</b>. In general, the steering actuator <b>108</b> is configured to adjust the direction of travel <b>14</b> of the work vehicle <b>10</b>. For example, the steering actuator <b>108</b> may correspond to an electric motor, an electric linear actuator, a hydraulic cylinder, a pneumatic cylinder, or any other suitable actuator coupled to suitable mechanical assembly, such as a rack and pinion or a worm gear assembly.</p>

Specifically, the control logic <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> is representative of steps of one embodiment of an algorithm that can be executed to adjust swath lines for a work vehicle based on one or more operating parameters of the vehicle and/or an associated implement to ensure the vehicle/implement can travel along the swath lines regardless of vehicle performance. Thus, in several embodiments, the control logic <b>200</b> may be advantageously utilized in association with a system installed on or forming part of a work vehicle to allow for real-time adjustment of swath lines for a work vehicle without requiring substantial computing resources and/or processing time. However, in other embodiments, the control logic <b>200</b> may be used in association with any other suitable system, application, and/or the like for generating swath lines for a work vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown, at (<b>202</b>), the control logic <b>200</b> includes accessing a swath line corresponding to a pass to be made across a field by a work vehicle. Specifically, in several embodiments, the computing system <b>112</b> may be configured to access a swath line corresponding to a pass to be made across a field (e.g., when performing an agricultural operation) by the vehicle/implement <b>10</b>/<b>12</b>. For example, in one embodiment, the swath line may be generated during a previous operation (such as by recording the travel path of a vehicle performing the previous operation) and stored in the memory device(s) <b>118</b> of the computing system <b>112</b>. Thereafter, the computing system <b>112</b> may retrieve the stored swath line from the memory device(s) <b>118</b> before performing the corresponding pass across the field.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Furthermore, at (<b>204</b>), the control logic <b>200</b> includes controlling the operation of the work vehicle such that the work vehicle travels along the swath line to make the pass across the field. Specifically, in several embodiments, the computing system <b>112</b> is configured to control the operation of one or more components of the work vehicle <b>10</b> and/or the associated implement <b>12</b> such that the vehicle/implement <b>10</b>/<b>12</b> makes a pass across the field (e.g., to perform an agricultural operation thereon). For example, the computing system <b>112</b> may receive location data (e.g., coordinates) from the location sensor <b>110</b> via the communicative link <b>114</b>. The received location data may, in turn, be used to determine the position of the vehicle/implement <b>10</b>/<b>12</b> relative to the accessed swath line. As such, the computing system <b>112</b> may transmit control signals to the steering actuator <b>108</b> via the communicative link <b>114</b> to control the direction of travel <b>14</b> of the vehicle/implement <b>10</b>/<b>12</b> such that the vehicle/implement <b>10</b>/<b>12</b> travels along the accessed swath line to make the pass.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Additionally, at (<b>206</b>), the control logic <b>200</b> includes receiving sensor data indicative of an operating parameter of the work vehicle. Specifically, as mentioned above, in several embodiments, the computing system <b>112</b> may be communicatively coupled to the operating parameter sensor(s) <b>111</b> via the communicative link <b>114</b>. In this respect, as the vehicle/implement <b>10</b>/<b>12</b> travels along the accessed swath line to make a pass across the field (e.g., to perform an agricultural operation thereon), the computing system <b>112</b> may receive data from the operating parameter sensor(s) <b>111</b>. Such data may, in turn, be indicative of one or more operating parameters of the work vehicle <b>10</b> and/or implement <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Moreover, at (<b>208</b>), the control logic <b>200</b> includes determining the operating parameter of the work vehicle based on the received sensor data as the work vehicle travels along the swath line. Specifically, in several embodiments, as the vehicle/implement <b>10</b>/<b>12</b> travels along the accessed swath line to make the pass, the computing system <b>112</b> may determine one or more operating parameters of the work vehicle <b>10</b> and/or the implement <b>12</b> based on the sensor data received at (<b>206</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">At (<b>208</b>), any suitable operating parameter(s) of the vehicle <b>10</b> and/or the implement <b>12</b> may be determined. For example, in some embodiments, the determined operating parameter(s) may include one or more vehicle dynamics parameters, such as the turning radius of the vehicle <b>10</b>, the slew rate of the vehicle <b>10</b> and the implement <b>12</b>, the lateral slip of the vehicle <b>10</b>, the understeer and/or oversteer of the vehicle <b>10</b>, and/or the like.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As will be described below, the operating parameter(s) determined at (<b>208</b>) is used to adjust accessed swath line to ensure the vehicle/implement <b>10</b>/<b>12</b> can travel along the swath line as the performance of the vehicle/implement <b>10</b>/<b>12</b> (e.g., its turning radius/slew rate) varies because of the field conditions. For example, the curved portion(s) of accessed swath line may be adjusted based on the determined operating parameter(s).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In addition, at (<b>210</b>), the control logic <b>200</b> includes determining the minimum turning radius of the work vehicle based on the determined operating parameter. More specifically, field conditions may impact the performance of the vehicle <b>10</b> and/or the implement <b>12</b>. For example, when the field is muddy, the minimum turning radius of the vehicle <b>10</b> and the minimum slew rate of the vehicle <b>10</b> and implement <b>12</b> may be less than when the field is dry. Thus, the minimum turning and slew radii may differ as field conditions vary. Moreover, vehicle loading may affect the minimum turning and slew radii. As such, in several embodiments, the computing system <b>112</b> may determine the minimum turning radius of the vehicle <b>10</b> and/or the minimum slew rate of the vehicle <b>10</b> and implement <b>12</b> based the determined operating parameter(s). For example, in one embodiment, the computing system <b>112</b> may use the determined turning radius of the vehicle <b>10</b> and the steering angle of the vehicle <b>10</b> to determine the minimum turning radius of the vehicle <b>10</b> under the current field conditions and/or vehicle loading.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Furthermore, at (<b>212</b>), the control logic <b>200</b> includes identifying a curved portion of the accessed swath line positioned forward of the work vehicle relative to the direction of travel. Specifically, in several embodiments, the computing system <b>112</b> may analyze the portion of the accessed swath line positioned forward of the vehicle/implement <b>10</b>/<b>12</b> relative to the direction of travel <b>14</b> to identify any curved portions thereof. For example, the computing system <b>112</b> may use any suitable algorithm(s) or technique(s) to identify the curved portion(s) of the accessed swath line. Moreover, in some embodiments, at (<b>212</b>), the computing system <b>112</b> may determine the rate of change of the curvature of the curved portion.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Additionally, at (<b>214</b>), the control logic <b>200</b> includes determining the radius of a given identified curved portion. Specifically, in several embodiments, the computing system <b>112</b> may determine the radius of a given curved portion of the swath line identified at (<b>212</b>). For example, the computing system <b>112</b> may use any suitable algorithm(s) or technique(s) to determine the radius of the given curved portion.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Moreover, at (<b>216</b>), the control logic <b>200</b> includes comparing the determined minimum turning radius of the work vehicle to the determined radius of the given identified curved portion. Specifically, in several embodiments, the computing system <b>112</b> may compare the minimum turning radius of the work vehicle <b>10</b> and/or the slew angle of the vehicle <b>10</b> and the implement <b>12</b> determined at (<b>210</b>) to the radius of the given identified curved portion determined at (<b>214</b>). When the minimum turning radius of the work vehicle <b>10</b> the vehicle <b>10</b> and the implement <b>12</b> is less the radius of the given curved portion, no adjustment of the given curved portion of the swath line is needed.

Conversely, when the minimum turning radius of the work vehicle <b>10</b> of the vehicle <b>10</b> and the implement <b>12</b> is greater the radius of the given identified curved portion, the vehicle <b>10</b> and/or implement <b>12</b> are unable to traverse the given curved portion. In such instances, the control logic <b>200</b> proceeds to (<b>218</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Additionally, or an alternative, at (<b>216</b>), the computing system <b>112</b> may compare the determined rate of change of the curvature of the curved portion determined at (<b>212</b>) to the predetermined maximum rate of change. When the determined rate of change of the curvature is less the predetermined maximum rate of change, no adjustment of the given curved portion of the swath line is needed, In such instances, the control logic <b>200</b> proceeds to (<b>220</b>). Conversely, when the determined rate of change of the curvature is greater the predetermined maximum rate of change, the vehicle <b>10</b> and/or implement <b>12</b> are unable to traverse the given curved portion. In such instances, the control logic <b>200</b> proceeds to (<b>218</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In addition, at (<b>218</b>), the control logic <b>200</b> includes adjusting the given curved portion of the accessed swath line such that the radius of the given curved portion is increased. Specifically, in such instances, the computing system <b>112</b> may adjust the given curved portion of the accessed swath line such that its radius is increased, thereby allowing the vehicle/implement <b>10</b>/<b>12</b> to travel long the adjusted portion. For example, the radius of the given curved portion may be increased to be equal to or greater than (e.g., five percent greater than) than the minimum turning radius or slew radii (e.g., whichever is larger).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> illustrates an example swath line <b>230</b> for use in guiding the vehicle/implement <b>10</b>/<b>12</b> across the field.

Furthermore, the swath line <b>130</b> includes a first curved portion <b>236</b> extending from a point <b>238</b> to a point <b>240</b> and a second curved portion <b>242</b> extending from a point <b>240</b> to a point <b>244</b>. As shown, the first and second curved portions <b>236</b>, <b>242</b> have been adjusted (e.g., as indicated by dashed lines <b>246</b> and <b>248</b>, respectively) to increase their radii. Thus, the minimum turning and slew radii needed to traverse the adjusted curved portions <b>246</b>, <b>248</b> is greater, thereby allowing vehicle/implement <b>10</b>/<b>12</b> to travel along these portions, such as in muddy conditions or under high vehicle loading.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, at (<b>220</b>), the control logic <b>200</b> includes determining whether there are any other curved portions of the accessed swath that need to be analyzed.

When another curved portion of the swath line needs to be analyzed, the control logic <b>200</b> returns to (<b>214</b>). Conversely, when there are no other curved portions of the swath line that need to he analyzed, the control logic <b>200</b> proceeds to (<b>222</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Moreover, at (<b>222</b>), the control logic <b>200</b> includes controlling the operation of the work vehicle such that the work vehicle travels along the adjusted portion of the swath line. Specifically, in several embodiments, the computing system <b>112</b> is configured to configured to control the operation of one or more components of the work vehicle <b>10</b> and/or the associated implement <b>12</b> such that the vehicle/implement <b>10</b>/<b>12</b> travels along the adjusted swath line.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Adjusting a swath line used to guide the work vehicle/implement <b>10</b>/<b>12</b> across a field based on an operating parameter(s) determined as the vehicle/implement <b>10</b>/<b>12</b> travels across the field improves the operation of the vehicle <b>10</b> and/or the implement <b>12</b>. More specifically, as described above, field conditions and/or vehicle loading may affect the performance the vehicle <b>10</b> and/or the implement <b>12</b>. As such, in certain instances, the vehicle/implement <b>10</b>/<b>12</b> may be unable to follow the swath line being used to guide the vehicle. In this respect, by adjusting the swath line (e.g., by increasing the radius of its curved portions) based on a monitored operating parameter(s), the control logic <b>200</b> ensures that the vehicle implement <b>10</b>/<b>12</b> can traverse the swath line as field conditions and/or vehicle loading vary.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In addition, the same field conditions may affect different vehicles differently. For example, the turning radius of one work vehicle may be more impacted by the same muddy conditions than another work vehicle. Furthermore, differing vehicle loading may cause the same field conditions to affect a vehicle differently. Thus, by relying on operating parameters of the vehicle (e.g., vehicle dynamics and/or loading parameter(s)) as opposed to field condition data, the control logic <b>200</b> ensure different work vehicles and vehicles of varying loads can traverse the swath line.</p>
