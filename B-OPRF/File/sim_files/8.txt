As will be discussed, the first and second plates <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> may support other components of the central assembly <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the central assembly <b>148</b> may further include a trough member <b>156</b>. The trough member <b>156</b> may be generally box-shaped with an open top end <b>158</b>. The trough member <b>156</b> may include a rear wall <b>160</b> that faces generally toward the rear end <b>116</b> of the vehicle <b>100</b>. The trough member <b>156</b> may also include an opposite front wall <b>162</b>. The trough member <b>156</b> may further include an upper lip <b>164</b> that defines the open top end <b>158</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The trough member <b>156</b> may be elongate along the lateral axis <b>124</b> between the first plate <b>152</b> and the second plate <b>154</b>. The upper lip <b>164</b> may be supported atop and fixed to the first plate <b>152</b>, the second plate <b>154</b> and/or other portions of the frame <b>150</b>. The trough member <b>156</b> may receive the seed, fertilizer, or other commodity within the commodity container <b>128</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>). The commodity may collect within the trough member <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the rear wall <b>160</b> of the trough member <b>156</b> may include one or more wall members <b>166</b>. In some embodiments, a representative wall member <b>166</b> may be substantially thin, flat plate with an upper flange <b>168</b>. The wall member <b>166</b> may be mounted for movement to a respective support member <b>170</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). In some embodiments, the wall member <b>166</b> may be slideably supported by support members <b>170</b> (i.e., slider supports) on opposite edges of the wall member <b>166</b>. Accordingly, the wall member <b>166</b> may slide upward to a raised position and slide downward to a lowered position. (In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, an end wall member <b>172</b> is shown in the raised position, and the remaining wall members <b>166</b> are shown in the lowered position.) In some embodiments, the wall members <b>166</b> may be controlled by an actuator, such as a mechanical linear actuator, a solenoid, etc. The control system <b>140</b> may control the actuator for controlled movement of the wall members <b>166</b>. It will be appreciated that the wall member <b>166</b> may be positioned in the raised position, the lowered position, and any number of intermediate positions. The position of the wall member <b>166</b> may control the size (i.e., area) of a rear opening <b>174</b> of the trough member <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The commodity may pass out of the trough member <b>156</b> via the rear openings <b>174</b> and fall toward the metering system <b>130</b> as will be discussed in greater detail below. Thus, when raised, the wall members <b>166</b> may increase the flow of commodity out of the trough member <b>156</b>. On the contrary, when lowered, the wall members <b>166</b> may impede flow of commodity out of the trough member <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>11</b>, and <b>12</b></figref>, the metering system <b>130</b> will be discussed in greater detail according to example embodiments. In some embodiments, the metering system <b>130</b> may be a volumetric metering system. In other embodiments, the metering system <b>130</b> may include be a singulating meter.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the metering system <b>130</b> may include at least one metering assembly <b>203</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, there are two metering assemblies <b>203</b> that extend along the lateral axis <b>124</b> of the vehicle <b>100</b>. One of the metering assemblies <b>203</b> is proximate the first side <b>120</b> of the vehicle <b>100</b>, and the other metering assembly <b>203</b> is proximate the second side <b>120</b>. The metering assemblies <b>203</b> may be substantially similar.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As an example, the metering assembly <b>203</b> may be supported on one or more metering support structures <b>202</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>12</b></figref>). In the illustrated embodiment, the metering assembly <b>203</b> may include at least two support structures <b>202</b> with one at each lateral end of the metering assembly <b>203</b>. The support structures <b>202</b> may be substantially similar to each other. The metering support structure <b>202</b> may be a rigid member made, for example, from bent, welded, or otherwise formed steel plate. The metering support structure <b>202</b> may be elongate and may be pivotally attached at a first joint <b>204</b> to the frame <b>150</b>. More specifically, the metering support structure <b>202</b> may be rotatably attached to the plate <b>152</b> by a pin, a hinge, a bearing, or other fastener. In some embodiments, the metering assembly <b>203</b> may rotate about an axis of rotation that extends substantially parallel to the lateral axis <b>124</b>. Accordingly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the metering assembly <b>203</b> may rotatably move between a between a first position (i.e., a retracted or lowered position) (shown in phantom) and a second position (i.e., an extended or raised position) (shown in solid lines) relative to the frame <b>150</b>. As shown, the metering assembly <b>203</b> may swing generally rearward toward the rear end <b>116</b> of the vehicle <b>100</b> and upward (i.e., clockwise as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) when moving from the first position to the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the metering assembly <b>203</b> may also include one or more retainers that selectively retain the metering assembly <b>203</b> in the first position, in the second position, and/or in an intermediate position. The retainer may include a latch, a prop bar, a fastener, or other structures. Furthermore, the metering assembly <b>203</b> may be manually moved by one person and by-hand (i.e., without the aid of additional tools). Thus, the metering assembly <b>203</b> may be easily moved, for example, when cleaning-out the metering assembly <b>203</b>. In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>, the metering assembly <b>203</b> may have a large range of motion for moving between the first and second positions. Accordingly, the interior components described in detail below may be highly accessible for cleaning, repair, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Moreover, the central assembly <b>148</b> may further include a first covering structure <b>238</b> and a second covering structure <b>235</b>. The first and second covering structures <b>238</b>, <b>235</b> may be substantially similar to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As a representative example, the covering structure <b>238</b> may include a relatively flat panel <b>239</b>. The panel <b>239</b> may be made from sheet metal and may be substantially rigid in some embodiments. The panel <b>239</b> may also be rectangular and may include a first edge <b>246</b>, a second edge <b>248</b>, a first side edge <b>250</b>, and a second side edge <b>252</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Furthermore, the covering structure <b>238</b> may include one or more covering support structures <b>243</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>, <b>4</b>, and <b>12</b></figref>). In the illustrated embodiment, the covering structure <b>238</b> may include at least two support structures <b>243</b> with one at each lateral end of the panel <b>239</b>. The support structures <b>243</b> may be substantially similar to each other. The covering support structure <b>243</b> may be a rigid member made, for example, from bent, welded, or otherwise formed steel plate. The covering support structure <b>243</b> may be elongate and may be pivotally attached at a second joint <b>240</b> to the support structure <b>202</b> of the metering assembly <b>203</b>. More specifically, the covering support structure <b>243</b> may be rotatably attached to the metering support structure <b>202</b> by a bracket, a hinge, a pin, a bearing, or other hardware. Also, the second joint <b>240</b> may be disposed proximate the second edge <b>248</b> (i.e., the lower edge) of the panel <b>239</b>. The covering support structure <b>243</b> may rotate about an axis of rotation that extends substantially parallel to the lateral axis <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Accordingly, the first covering structure <b>238</b> and the second covering structure <b>235</b> may independently move relative to the respective metering assembly <b>203</b> between a number of positions. In some embodiments, the covering structures <b>238</b>, <b>235</b> may have a first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>), wherein the panels <b>239</b> cover over the rear-facing portions of the metering assemblies <b>203</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the second covering structure <b>235</b> is shown in a second position, wherein the panel <b>239</b> has rotated (flipped) downward to be substantially parallel to the ground and to expose the metering assembly <b>203</b>. Also, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the first covering structure <b>238</b> is shown in a third position, wherein the panel <b>239</b> has rotated (flipped) further downward to be more perpendicular to the ground and wherein the metering assembly <b>203</b> is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, the covering structures <b>238</b>, <b>235</b> may include one or more retainers that selectively retain the panel <b>239</b> in the first position, the second position, and/or the third position. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the retainer may include at least one magnetic element <b>254</b> that releasably and magnetically retains the panel <b>239</b> in the first position. The magnetic element <b>254</b> may be a permanent magnet supported on the panel <b>239</b>, proximate the first edge <b>246</b>. The magnetic element <b>254</b> may magnetically attach to the metallic material of the trough member <b>156</b> in some embodiments. In other embodiments, the covering structures <b>238</b>, <b>235</b> may include different retainers, such as a mechanical latch. It will be appreciated that the retainers are optional and that, in additional embodiments, the covering structure <b>238</b>, <b>235</b> may be self-supporting such that the panel <b>239</b> remains stationary and fixed in the first position due to the way that its weight is distributed on the metering assembly <b>203</b> at the first position.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The covering structures <b>238</b>, <b>235</b> provide several advantages. For example, the covering structures <b>238</b>, <b>235</b> may selectively cover over the metering assembly <b>203</b>, protecting these components from the elements, from dust, and other foreign objects. Moreover, the covering structures <b>238</b>, <b>235</b> may be easily moved to expose the metering assembly <b>203</b>, for example, during clean-out, repair, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">It is also noted that the metering assembly <b>203</b> is highly accessible. Indeed, the covering structure <b>238</b>, <b>235</b> may be moved relative to the metering assembly <b>203</b> to expose the rear-facing portions of the metering assembly <b>203</b>. Also, the metering assembly <b>203</b> may be moved relative to the frame <b>150</b> to expose the front-facing portions of the metering assembly <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b></figref>, components of the metering assembly <b>203</b> will be discussed according to example embodiments of the present disclosure. As shown, the metering assembly <b>203</b> may include a metering element <b>206</b>. In some embodiments, the metering element <b>206</b> may be a rotatable metering element <b>206</b> that provides volumetric metering. The metering element <b>206</b> may be referred to as a roller or a roller cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The rotatable metering element <b>206</b> may include a shaft <b>208</b> with a first end <b>209</b> and a second end <b>211</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). The shaft <b>208</b> may have a relatively straight axis that extends substantially parallel to the lateral axis <b>124</b>. The metering element <b>206</b> may also include a plurality of wheels <b>210</b> that are supported on the shaft <b>208</b>. The wheels <b>210</b> may include a plurality of projections <b>212</b> that project radially away from the wheel <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Additionally, the metering element <b>206</b> may include at least bearing structure <b>214</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>). For example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, there may be a bearing structure <b>214</b> that rotatably supports the first end <b>209</b> of the shaft <b>208</b>. Although not shown, there may also be a bearing structure <b>214</b> that rotatably supports the second end <b>211</b> of the shaft. The bearing structure <b>214</b> may include an outer structure (e.g., an outer race of the bearing) that is configured to releasably attach to the metering support structure <b>202</b>. In some embodiments, the bearing structure <b>214</b> may be rectangular or cruciform in shape and may include one or more (e.g., four) grooves <b>258</b>. The bearing structure <b>214</b> may be received in an opening of the metering support structure <b>202</b>, and one or more of the grooves <b>258</b> may receive an edge of the metering support structure <b>202</b> to support the bearing structure <b>214</b> thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, the metering assembly <b>203</b> may further include a latch mechanism <b>224</b>. The latch mechanism <b>224</b> may include a lever <b>221</b> with a first portion <b>217</b> and a second portion <b>219</b> that are separated at a distance. In some embodiments, the lever <b>221</b> may be generally L-shaped. Also, the first portion <b>217</b> of the lever <b>221</b> may include a hook feature <b>223</b>. The lever <b>221</b> may be attached to the metering support structure <b>202</b>, and the lever <b>221</b> may rotate between a latched position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>) and an unlatched position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>). In the latched position, the hook feature <b>223</b> may engage the bearing structure <b>214</b> of the metering element <b>206</b>. For example, the hook feature <b>223</b> may be received within a notch <b>256</b> of the bearing structure <b>214</b> for engagement and attaching the metering element <b>206</b> to the metering support structure <b>202</b>. When the latch mechanism <b>224</b> is in the unlatched position, the hook feature <b>223</b> may be disposed outside the notch <b>256</b> to release the bearing structure <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Additionally, in some embodiments, the latch mechanism <b>224</b> may include a biasing member <b>230</b>. The biasing member <b>230</b> may include a spring, such as a compression spring, a torsion spring, etc. The biasing member <b>230</b> may bias the lever <b>221</b> toward the latched position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>). Accordingly, when unlatching the metering element <b>206</b>, the user may press against the first portion <b>217</b> of the lever <b>221</b>, against the biasing force provided by the biasing member <b>230</b> until the hook feature <b>223</b> moves out of the notch <b>256</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Moreover, in some embodiments, as the lever <b>221</b> rotates toward the unlatched position, the second portion <b>219</b> may rotate toward and abut against the bearing structure <b>214</b> and push the metering element <b>206</b> away from the metering support structure <b>202</b>. Accordingly, the lever <b>221</b> may assist the user in removal of the metering element <b>206</b> from the metering support structure <b>202</b> for added convenience.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When re-assembling the metering element <b>206</b>, the user may press the bearing structure <b>214</b> of the metering element <b>206</b> against the latch mechanism <b>224</b> and move the lever <b>221</b> toward the unlatched position. The user may continue pushing the bearing structure <b>214</b> into place, allowing the biasing member <b>230</b> to bias the hook feature <b>223</b> into engagement with the bearing structure <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>8</b> and <b>9</b></figref>, the metering assembly <b>203</b> may further include a plurality of commodity tubes <b>216</b>. The commodity tubes <b>216</b> may be referred to as commodity cups. As an example, the commodity tube <b>216</b> may include a plurality of side walls <b>218</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b>, <b>8</b>, and <b>9</b></figref>). The side walls <b>218</b> may be arranged about a tube axis <b>227</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) so as to define a passage <b>225</b>. The passage <b>225</b> may have a first end <b>220</b> and a second end <b>222</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The commodity tubes <b>216</b> may be supported by one or more transverse support bars <b>201</b>, which extend between the metering support structures <b>202</b>. As such, the first end <b>220</b> of the commodity tube <b>216</b> may be disposed proximate the metering element <b>206</b> for receiving the commodity. Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, an opposing pair of the side walls <b>218</b> may define a notch <b>264</b> in the commodity tube <b>216</b>. The notch <b>264</b> may extend at an angle relative to the tube axis <b>227</b>. The notch <b>264</b> may receive the shaft <b>208</b> of the metering element <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>6</b> and <b>7</b></figref>, the metering assembly <b>203</b> may include a plurality of divider members <b>232</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the divider member <b>232</b> may include a barrier wall <b>234</b> and one or more retainers <b>236</b>. The barrier wall <b>234</b> may be a relatively flat plate of material, such as a polymeric material. The barrier wall <b>234</b> may include a notch-like opening <b>237</b> in some embodiments. The opening <b>237</b> may receive the shaft <b>208</b> of the metering element <b>206</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. In some embodiments, the barrier wall <b>234</b> may be substantially C-shaped and may include retainer <b>236</b> at each end. The retainers <b>236</b> may be integrally attached to the barrier wall <b>234</b> so as to be monolithic. The retainers <b>236</b> may be configured as resiliently flexible clips in some embodiments; however, it will be appreciated that the retainers <b>236</b> could be bolts, separate fasteners, or other components without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. In some embodiments, the retainer <b>236</b> may curve away from the barrier wall <b>234</b> and back toward the barrier wall <b>234</b>. Accordingly, the retainer <b>236</b> may define an open end <b>260</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, the retainers <b>236</b> of the divider member <b>232</b> may have different orientations relative to each other. For example, the orientation of one retainer <b>236</b> may be oriented approximately ninety degrees (90&#xb0;) relative to the other (i.e., orthogonal orientations). Stated differently, the open end <b>260</b> of one retainer <b>236</b> may be directed along the fore-aft axis <b>118</b>, and the open end <b>260</b> of the other retainer <b>236</b> may be directed along the vertical axis <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>, the divider member <b>232</b> may be removably attached to a side wall <b>218</b> of a commodity tube <b>216</b>. Specifically, the open ends <b>260</b> of the retainers <b>236</b> may receive a lip <b>262</b> of the commodity tube <b>216</b> proximate the first end <b>220</b> of the passage <b>225</b>. (One retainer <b>236</b> may receive a vertical lip <b>262</b>, and the other retainer <b>236</b> may receive a horizontal lip <b>262</b> as shown.) The lip <b>262</b> may include an enlarged ridge <b>263</b>. Once attached, the resiliency of the retainers <b>236</b> and the enlarged ridge <b>263</b> may help retain the divider member <b>232</b> to the commodity tube <b>216</b>. The barrier wall <b>234</b> may be received within and may be layered over the inner surface of the side wall <b>218</b>. Also, the shaft <b>208</b> may be received within the opening <b>237</b> of the divider member <b>232</b>. Accordingly, the barrier wall <b>234</b> may act as a barrier for directing the commodity as it falls through the commodity tube <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Furthermore, the divider member <b>232</b> may facilitate assembly, disassembly, and re-assembly of the metering element <b>206</b>. For example, because of the orientation of the retainers <b>236</b>, the divider member <b>232</b> may be retained to the side wall <b>218</b> and, yet, may float along at least two axes (e.g., the fore-aft axis <b>118</b> and the vertical axis <b>126</b>). This may facilitate installation of the metering element <b>206</b>. In some cases, the divider members <b>232</b> or other components may be slightly misaligned. Regardless, the metering element <b>206</b> may be inserted, pushing the divider member <b>232</b> into alignment due to the orientation of the retainers <b>236</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">During operation of the metering assembly <b>203</b>, the metering element <b>206</b> may rotate about the axis of the shaft <b>208</b>. Commodity from the trough member <b>156</b> may fall onto the wheels <b>210</b> of the metering element <b>206</b>. As the metering element <b>206</b> rotates, the commodity may fall from the wheels <b>210</b> and into the first end <b>220</b> of the passage <b>225</b>. The commodity may fall through the passage <b>225</b> and exit the commodity tube <b>216</b> through the second end <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b></figref>, the airflow system <b>132</b> will be discussed in greater detail. As mentioned above, the airflow system <b>132</b> may include a fan <b>134</b> that generates the airflow (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). The airflow system <b>132</b> may also include at least one upstream duct structure <b>266</b> that is fluidly connected to the fan <b>134</b> to receive airflow therefrom. The airflow system <b>132</b> may further include at least one plenum assembly <b>268</b>, which is fluidly connected to the upstream duct structure <b>266</b> to receive airflow therefrom. In some embodiments, the plenum assembly <b>268</b> may also receive the commodity metered out from the metering assembly <b>203</b>, and blow the commodity toward the distribution system <b>136</b> for delivery to the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, there may be a first plenum assembly <b>268</b> and a second plenum assembly <b>270</b>. Accordingly, each metering assembly <b>203</b> may have an associated plenum assembly <b>268</b>, <b>270</b>. The plenum assemblies <b>268</b>, <b>270</b> may be substantially similar to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>13</b></figref>, the plenum assembly <b>268</b> may include a plenum <b>272</b>. The plenum may be a hollow member with an inlet end <b>274</b> and an outlet end <b>280</b>. The plenum <b>272</b> may define an axis <b>276</b> that extends between the inlet end <b>274</b> and the outlet end <b>280</b>. The inlet end <b>274</b> may be substantially circular in cross section. The inlet end <b>274</b> may be fluidly connected to the upstream duct structure <b>266</b>. The plenum <b>272</b> may taper outward in width (i.e., along the lateral axis <b>124</b>) as the plenum <b>272</b> extends in a downstream direction from the inlet end <b>274</b>, generally rearward toward a curved segment <b>278</b>. The axis <b>276</b> may turn forward through the curved segment <b>278</b>. Also, the plenum <b>272</b> may include a stepped wall <b>282</b> that defines the outlet end <b>280</b>. The wall <b>282</b> may include a plurality of apertures <b>284</b> (e.g., through-holes) extending therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The plenum assembly <b>268</b> may also include a plenum support structure <b>286</b>. The plenum support structure <b>286</b> may be made from a rigid and strong material, such as steel. In some embodiments, the support structure <b>286</b> may include a mount <b>288</b> and a bracket <b>290</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>). The mount <b>288</b> may include a base flange <b>292</b> that extends along the lateral axis <b>124</b>. The mount <b>288</b> may further include a plurality of projections <b>294</b>. The projections <b>294</b> may be spaced apart along the lateral length of the mount <b>288</b>. As shown, the projections <b>294</b> may extend from the base flange <b>292</b> at an angle (e.g., at an acute angle relative to the lateral axis <b>124</b> and the vertical axis <b>126</b>. The mount <b>288</b> may additionally include a backing plate <b>289</b>. The backing plate <b>289</b> may be disposed inside the plenum <b>272</b>. The projections <b>294</b> and the backing plate <b>289</b> may sandwich a part of the stepped wall <b>282</b> therebetween and a plurality of fasteners <b>320</b> may be used for attaching the mount <b>288</b> to the stepped wall.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The brackets <b>290</b> may be attached to opposite ends of the mount <b>288</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. The brackets <b>290</b> may also be attached to the frame <b>150</b> at a third joint <b>296</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>). In some embodiments, the brackets <b>290</b> may support rotational movement of the plenum assembly <b>268</b> relative to the frame <b>150</b> about the third joint <b>296</b>. The axis of rotation of the third joint <b>296</b> may extend substantially parallel to the lateral axis <b>124</b>. Thus, the plenum assembly <b>268</b> may rotate between a raised position (shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>) and a lowered position (shown in solid lines). The plenum assembly <b>268</b> may rotate generally downward and forward when moving from the raised position to the lowered position. The plenum assembly <b>268</b> may also include a retainer (e.g., a latch) for retaining the plenum assembly <b>268</b>, for example, in the raised position. In some embodiments, the plenum assembly <b>268</b> may be connected to a portion of the metering assembly <b>203</b> when in the raised position, and the plenum assembly <b>268</b> may be spaced apart from the metering assembly <b>203</b> when in the lowered position.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some embodiments, the plenum assembly <b>268</b> may be lowered manually without the aid of extra tools. Also, the plenum assembly <b>268</b> may include a handle <b>299</b>. The handle <b>299</b> may be attached to the support structure <b>286</b> and may extend laterally across the curved segment <b>278</b> of the plenum <b>272</b>. The user may grasp the handle <b>299</b> for raising and lowering the plenum assembly <b>268</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">It will be appreciated that the range of motion of the plenum assembly <b>268</b> (between the raised position and the lowered position) is relatively large (e.g., at least eighty degrees of rotation about the third joint <b>296</b>). Accordingly, the plenum assembly <b>268</b> may swing downward and lowered out of the way to provide access to the metering assembly <b>203</b>. For example, the plenum assembly <b>268</b> may be lowered to provide access to the second end <b>222</b> of the commodity tubes <b>216</b>. In some embodiments, the plenum assembly <b>268</b> may swing far enough to allow access to the commodity tubes <b>216</b> along the axis <b>227</b> in an upstream direction (i.e., toward the first end <b>220</b>). In other words, the plenum assembly <b>268</b> may move far enough such that the axis <b>227</b> does not intersect the plenum assembly <b>268</b> as it extends out from the second end <b>222</b> of the commodity tube <b>216</b>. Accordingly, the plenum assembly <b>268</b> may be lowered to expose the metering assembly <b>203</b>, for example, when cleaning out the metering assembly <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, when the plenum assembly <b>268</b> is lowered, the covering structure <b>238</b> may be flipped down to the third position, wherein the covering structure <b>238</b> exposes the metering assembly <b>203</b> and is substantially perpendicular to the ground. This allows for increased access to the metering assembly <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>13</b> and <b>14</b></figref>, the plenum assembly <b>268</b> may further include at least one venturi structure <b>300</b>. The venturi structure <b>300</b> may be a unitary, one piece member in some embodiments. The venturi structure <b>300</b> may be made from a polymeric material in some embodiments. The venturi structure <b>300</b> may also be formed via molding, casting, additive manufacturing, or using other techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The venturi structure <b>300</b> may include a funnel portion <b>302</b> (i.e., a support structure). The funnel portion <b>302</b> may include a divider wall <b>304</b>. The divider wall <b>304</b> may divide the interior of the funnel portion <b>302</b> into a first passage <b>306</b> and a second passage <b>308</b>. The venturi structure <b>300</b> may also include a support plate <b>312</b> that extends from an upper lip of the funnel portion <b>302</b>. A slot <b>314</b> may be defined between the support plate and the funnel portion <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Additionally, the venturi structure <b>300</b> may include a first venturi tube <b>316</b> and a second venturi tube <b>318</b>. The first and second venturi tubes <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> may extend through the support plate <b>312</b> and may project forward from the funnel portion <b>302</b>. The first venturi tube <b>316</b> may be fluidly connected to the first passage <b>306</b>. Also, the first venturi tube <b>316</b> may extend substantially perpendicular relative to the first passage <b>306</b>. Furthermore, the second venturi tube <b>318</b> may be fluidly connected to the second passage <b>308</b> and may extend substantially perpendicular thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some embodiments, the first and second venturi tubes <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> may be offset along the lateral axis <b>124</b> with respect to each other. Also, the first and second venturi tubes <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> may be offset along the vertical axis <b>126</b> with respect to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The venturi structure <b>300</b> may be removeably attached to the plenum <b>272</b> and/or the mount <b>288</b>. For example, the projection <b>294</b> of the mount <b>288</b> may be received within the slot <b>314</b> of the venturi structure <b>300</b>. Moreover, a respective one of the fasteners <b>320</b> may extend through the projection <b>294</b>, the stepped wall <b>282</b> of the plenum <b>272</b>, the support plate <b>312</b> of the venturi structure <b>300</b>, and the backing plate <b>289</b> to secure the venturi structure <b>300</b> to the plenum <b>272</b> and the plenum support structure <b>286</b>. In some embodiments, the fastener <b>320</b> may be the only fastener needed for attaching the venturi structure <b>300</b>. Thus, the venturi structure <b>300</b> may be installed and removed relatively quickly and conveniently.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Also, the inlet ends of the first and second venturi tubes <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> may be fluidly connected to respective ones of the apertures <b>284</b> of the plenum <b>272</b>. The outlet ends of the venturi tubes <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> may be connected to respective hoses <b>322</b> of the distribution system <b>136</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">It will be appreciated that the staggered arrangement of the venturi tubes <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> may make the plenum assembly <b>268</b> relatively compact. Accordingly a large number of venturi tubes <b>316</b>, <b>318</b> may be arranged along the lateral axis <b>124</b>, and yet there can be enough room for the hoses <b>322</b> of the distribution system <b>136</b> and other structures on the work vehicle <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the work vehicle <b>100</b> may further include a control system <b>350</b>. The control system <b>350</b> may include and/or communicate with components of a computerized device, such as a processor, a data storage device, a user interface with a display and a keyboard or other related devices, etc. The control system <b>350</b> may communicate with an actuator <b>352</b>. In some embodiments, the actuator <b>352</b> may be operably connected to the metering element <b>206</b> for driving (e.g., rotating) the metering element <b>206</b>. The actuator <b>352</b> may be of any suitable type, such as an electric motor, a hydraulic actuator, or otherwise. Also, the control system <b>350</b> may be in communication with a sensor <b>354</b> configured to detect a speed (e.g., an angular speed) of the actuator <b>352</b> and/or the metering element <b>206</b>. The sensor <b>354</b> may be an optical sensor, an electrical sensor, or other type without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. Accordingly, in some embodiments, the control system <b>350</b> may control the motor <b>356</b> and receive associated feedback from the sensor <b>354</b> for closed-loop control. Also, in some embodiments, the control system <b>350</b> may be in communication with the fan <b>134</b> for controlling the airflow system <b>132</b>. It will be appreciated that the control system <b>350</b> may be in communication with and may control other systems as well.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the actuator <b>352</b> may include an electric motor <b>356</b>. The electric motor <b>356</b> may include a first output member <b>358</b> and a second output member <b>360</b>. The first output member <b>358</b> may be a shaft that is attached directly to the motor <b>356</b>. The second output member <b>360</b> may be a gear or other transmission component that selectively engages with the first output member <b>358</b>. The second output member <b>360</b> may be operably connected to the metering element <b>206</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the first and second output members <b>358</b>, <b>360</b> may be engaged such that power output from the motor is transferred to the metering element <b>206</b>. In contrast, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>, the first and second output members <b>358</b>, <b>360</b> may disengage when moving the metering assembly <b>203</b> from the lowered position to the raised position.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Accordingly, during operation, the work vehicle <b>100</b> may be towed across a field with the metering assembly <b>203</b>, and the plenum assembly <b>268</b> in the positions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> (i.e., the metering assembly <b>203</b> in the retracted position and the plenum assembly <b>268</b> in the raised position). The control system <b>350</b> may generate control signals for operating the electric motor <b>356</b> at a controlled speed, such that the metering element <b>206</b> meters out a predetermined amount of the commodity from the commodity container <b>128</b>. The commodity may travel through the commodity tube <b>216</b> and fall into either the first passage <b>306</b> or second passage <b>308</b> of the venturi structure <b>300</b>. The commodity may be ejected from the venturi structure <b>300</b> toward the distribution system <b>136</b> and ultimately to the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">There may be a need to clean out the metering assembly <b>203</b>. For example, the user may want to plant a different commodity than the one currently loaded. Internal components may also need to be reconfigured, replaced, repaired, etc. Advantageously, the metering assembly <b>203</b> and the plenum assembly <b>268</b> may move between various positions to facilitate clean-out, repair, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">For example, the metering assembly <b>203</b> and the plenum assembly <b>268</b> can be conveniently moved and accessed from the rear side <b>116</b> of the vehicle <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the metering assembly <b>203</b> may be disposed between the central wheels <b>112</b> of the vehicle <b>100</b>, allowing user access. Also, the metering assembly <b>203</b> may be disposed rearward with respect to the cutters, tillers, or other ground-engaging tools of the ground system <b>138</b>. More specifically, the metering assembly <b>203</b> may be disposed at a first axial position <b>101</b>, whereas the ground engaging-tools of the ground system <b>138</b> may be disposed at a second axial positon <b>103</b>. The first axial position <b>101</b> may be disposed rearward on the axis <b>118</b> relative to the second axial position <b>103</b>. Accordingly, the user may access the metering assembly <b>203</b> without interference from the ground system <b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Also, to access internal components of the metering assembly <b>203</b> and/or the plenum assembly <b>268</b>, the user manually uses the handle <b>299</b> to rotate and lower the plenum assembly <b>268</b> as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>10</b></figref>. In this position, the user may probe the second end <b>222</b> of the commodity tube <b>216</b>. Furthermore, the user may rotate and lift the metering assembly <b>203</b> as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>. This provides access to the metering assembly <b>203</b> as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. Moreover, the user may rotate and flip over the covering structure <b>238</b> as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>12</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Furthermore, the metering assembly <b>203</b> may be disposed high enough off of the ground to allow a receptacle <b>397</b> (e.g., a probox) to be placed underneath the metering assembly <b>203</b>. In some embodiments, with the plenum assembly <b>268</b> lowered and moved forward, the metering assembly <b>203</b> may disposed at a height <b>399</b> (measured from the ground, soil, etc.) of at least sixty-five inches (65 in.) to accommodate the receptacle <b>397</b>. The underside of the metering assembly <b>203</b> may be at least sixty-five inches off the ground in the lowered position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>11</b></figref>) as well. Accordingly, the receptacle <b>397</b> may be used to conveniently capture the commodity cleaned out of the metering assembly <b>203</b>.</p>
