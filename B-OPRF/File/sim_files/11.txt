<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">1. Field of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to garden weeders and other manually-operated weeding devices for use in removing weeds from soil.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Hand and foot-operated weeding tools have long been in-use for removing garden weeds and transplanting plants. The weeding tools typically operate using a lever to which foot pressure is applied to insert one or more forks into the soil around a weed, and then, using leverage produced by tilting a handle backward toward the operator, together with pushing on a lever with a foot, the forks are brought together and tilted out of the soil to extract the weed.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, existing designs are limited in that as the handle is tilted backward, foot pressure is lost due to the operator having to remove their foot if the handle must be tilted deeply for grasping deeply-rooted weeds. While such devices are suitable for shallow soil penetration, the grasping force and angle needed to extract deeper weeds makes their use unsuitable for that purpose. Further, existing designs are not adaptable to different soil conditions and weed root depth, placing all of the compensation for such variations on the operator attempting to use the tool for different soil conditions and weed depth.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a manually-operated weeding tool that can adapt to different soil and weed depth conditions, and that provides gripping strength that is not dependent on weight applied by a foot increasing during a weed extraction maneuver.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above objectives, among others, are achieved in a manually-operated weeding device and its method of operation in use.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The weeding device is a device for pulling a plant from soil, and includes an elongate handle and a weeder head affixed to the handle at an end of the handle. The weeder head includes a first fork extending along a long direction of the handle and away from the end of the handle and a rotating jaw rotatably mounted to the weeder head by an axle extending in a first direction perpendicular to the long direction of the handle. The rotating jaw has a second fork displaced from the axle in a second direction perpendicular to the long direction of the handle and perpendicular to the first direction on a first side of the handle, so that the second fork is displaced from the first fork when the second fork is rotated to be parallel to the first fork. The weeder head further includes a step rigidly affixed to the weeder head and extending along the second direction on a second side of the handle opposite the first side to provide a platform for applying foot pressure to insert the first and second forks in the soil prior to rotating the handle. The rotating jaw has a lever extension mechanically coupled to and extending from the second fork to an end of the lever extension on the second side of the handle, so that the lever extension contacts the soil when the first fork and the second fork are fully inserted in the soil, and so that as the handle is rotated toward the soil, the lever extension rotates with respect to the handle due to contact of the edge of the lever extension with the soil and causes a tip of the second fork to incline toward a tip of the first fork to close the first fork and the second fork around a plant.</p>

The description below sets forth example embodiments according to this disclosure. Further embodiments and implementations will be apparent to those having ordinary skill in the art. Persons having ordinary skill in the art will recognize that various equivalent techniques may be applied in lieu of, or in conjunction with, the embodiments discussed below, and all such equivalents are encompassed by the present disclosure.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present disclosure encompasses new weeding devices, their methods of operation and weeder heads that provide significant advantages in removing weeds in difficult soil conditions and weeds with deep roots. i.e., weeding in conditions that ordinarily require large amounts of weight to be applied to a weeding tool. The weeding device provides leverage for pulling a deeply-rooted plant from soil without requiring excessive foot pressure for operation. A handle is attached to a weeder head having a first fork extending away from the end of the handle. A rotating jaw is mounted to the weeder head, and has a second fork displaced from the first fork when the second fork are parallel. The weeding device has a step for applying foot pressure to insert the first and second forks in the soil prior. A lever extension of the rotating jaw on an opposite side of the handle contacts the soil when the forks are fully inserted in the soil, and as the handle is rotated toward the soil a tip of the second fork inclines toward a tip of the first fork to close the first fork and the second fork around a plant. The lever extension may include two lever extensions on either face of the weeding tool, so that the application of extraction force is balanced on both sides of the tool.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In at least one example embodiment, the forks of the weeding device are capable of completely entering the soil to their full tine length, and rather than stepping on the element that provides leverage to close the forks, i.e., the lever extension(s) of the rotating jaw that contact the soil during weed extraction, a separate step is provided that is rigidly attached to the handle. In the disclosed embodiments, the pivot point of the rotating jaw lever extension(s) is located near the end of the handle and moves with the handle as the handle is rotated, which increases the gripping force provided between the forks, while minimizing the torque that must be supplied to the handle to close the forks together. The forks are closed together immediately as the handle is rotated and are both in movement, the first fork due to the rotation of the handle, the second fork due to the rotation of the rotating jaw caused by the contact of the lever extension(s) with the soil as the handle is rotated. Such operation is suitable for extracting weeds including those with very deep roots and those implanted in very tough soils, as the force that brings the forks together due to the contact of the lever extension(s) with the soil increases as the torque applied to the handle is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, a perspective view of an example weeding tool <b>10</b> is shown, according to an embodiment of the disclosure. A handle <b>14</b> includes a grip portion <b>12</b> which may be, for example, a plastic or rubber cover slid over handle <b>14</b> to provide a hand gripping area on handle. A weeder head <b>20</b> is attached to handle <b>14</b> by insertion of the end of handle <b>14</b> opposite grip <b>12</b> into a sleeve <b>16</b> of weeder head <b>20</b>. A step <b>18</b> provides the force for inserting tines <b>28</b> of a pair of forks <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B into soil, and includes a step portion <b>18</b>A for receiving pressure from a foot of an operator of weeding tool <b>10</b> that provides the fork insertion force, and a curved support portion <b>18</b>B. Fork <b>24</b>A is rigidly connected to sleeve <b>16</b>, e.g., by welding, and may be integral with the metal bar forming step <b>18</b>, which may then be welded or otherwise attached to sleeve <b>16</b>. Fork <b>24</b>B is rigidly connected to a rotating jaw <b>25</b> that is secured to weeder head <b>20</b> by an axle <b>27</b>, which in the exemplary embodiment, is supplied by a removable bolt. Rotating jaw <b>25</b> terminates in a pair of lever extensions <b>22</b> that contact the soil as handle <b>14</b> is rotated in the direction of step <b>18</b> (generally toward the operator) and cause tines <b>28</b> of forks <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B to come together to grip a weed. An adjustment mechanism <b>26</b> is supplied by a thumb-turn bolt inserted in a threaded hole provided in a frame of rotating jaw <b>25</b> and sets an initial distance between the tips of tines <b>28</b>. The initial distance is nominally 1 inch between forks <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B, which are parallel at that adjustment point, but adjustment mechanism <b>26</b> provides for adjustment on either side of the nominal adjustment point, so that forks <b>24</b>A and <b>24</b>B may form an acute or obtuse angle therebetween, depending on the requirements for pulling particular weeds. Referring additionally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b>A</figref>, which shows an enlarged view of fork <b>24</b>A, the tip features of which are the same as those of fork <b>24</b>B, forks <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B have a separation width W<sub>1 </sub>of &#xbe;-inch at the tips of tines <b>28</b>, and an overall length L<sub>1 </sub>of 4 inches that extends from the tips of tines <b>28</b> to the center of rotation of rotating jaw <b>25</b>. The inter-tine depth D<sub>1 </sub>of forks <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B is 2 inches, and the thickness T of forks <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B is &#xbc; inch (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b>B</figref>). The unadjusted displacement d between forks <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B in the direction of handle <b>14</b> at axle <b>27</b> is one inch (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b>A</figref>), which gives a gripping strength to extract a wide range of roots with sufficient gripping strength to extract the roots. Rotating jaw <b>25</b> is removable and may be interchanged with other designs as described below, depending on the particular soil conditions, types of weeds that are to be extracted, and also depending on the tolerable disturbance of the soil. Rotating jaw <b>25</b> provides a combination of soil penetration and gripping surface area that allows the user to extract small weeds from lawns or landscape, but also has the ability to extract larger weeds. Forks <b>24</b>B (as well as fixed forks <b>24</b>A) provide a slim profile that can penetrate deeply into moderate-to-hard soils with ease in extracting the weed with entirety of the root. The design of forks <b>24</b>B also limit the amount of soil removed with the root, thereby minimizing the size of divots produced in the soil/lawn when extracting a weed. Forks <b>24</b>B also have a taper that is formed. The two-tine design of forks <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B have a two-step taper between tines <b>28</b>, which is formed by a &#x201c;V&#x201d;-shaped opening <b>29</b>A that reduces to a slot <b>29</b>B with a curved termination <b>29</b>C, which admits enough soil for compression around the root that provides clamping pressure that will hold the root in place between the opposing forks <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B for removal of the root when handle <b>14</b> is rotated. The spacing between tines <b>28</b> allows for the pulling of large weeds with thick root bases through clamping but also a &#x201c;wedging&#x201d; action between tines <b>28</b>. However, the design of forks <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B does require a more precise placement of forks <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B over a weed, so that the weed base or root will be wedged in between tines <b>28</b> of either or both of forks <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B, so that the root base is gripped by a combination of wedging between tines <b>28</b> and clamping pressure applied between forks <b>24</b>A, <b>24</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C</figref>, a front view, a side view, and a bottom end view of example weeding tool <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> are shown, respectively, in accordance with an embodiment of the disclosure. Details of the shape of the bar forming step <b>18</b> and fork <b>24</b>A are illustrated, as well as the initial spatial relationship between lever extensions <b>22</b> and curved support portion <b>18</b>A of step <b>18</b>, which, contrary to the curved foot of some manual weeding devices, is curved for the purpose of avoiding contact with the soil as lever extension(s) <b>22</b> contact the soil and rotating jaw <b>25</b> rotates around axle <b>27</b>, rather than curved support portion <b>18</b>A contacting the soil to provide a base for rotation, as in some existing weeder designs.</p>

A bolt <b>32</b> is inserted through holes in rotating jaw <b>25</b> and through cylindrical bushing <b>33</b> to form axle <b>27</b> and is secured with a nut <b>34</b>, providing a simple, removable axle, that can be used to interchange rotating jaw <b>25</b>.
