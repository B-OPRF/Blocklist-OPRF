<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to the use of reactive oxygen species to increase the enzyme activity and increase dry matter in hydroponically germinated seeds. Reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide have been used to promote the germination percentage of seedlings. More particularly, but not exclusively, the present invention relates to processes and compositions for increasing enzyme concentrations using reactive oxygen species in hydroponically grown cellulosic materials.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Germination and seedling development in angiosperms is commonly regulated by two antagonist phytohormones, gibberellins and abscisic acid. The release of gibberellins supports the break of dormancy, cell division, and the release of hydrolytic enzymes whereas the release of abscisic acid maintains seed dormancy, inhibits the release of hydrolytic enzymes and reduced cellular division. The oxidative mode of action of gibberellins is mimicked in vivo when reactive oxygen species are introduced; supporting the release of hydrolytic enzymes from the aleurone layer and other plant cellular tissues. In addition, ligninolytic enzymes such as peroxidases favor delignification pathways when reactive oxygen species are present in contrast to lignification reactions when reactive oxygen species are absent. Delignification facilitated by ligninolytic enzyme hydrolysis supports improved fiber digestibility as lignin is generally regarded as the most complex and indigestible fiber complex in higher plants. Therefore, what is needed is the application of reactive oxygen species in hydroponic environments to increase dry matter and enzymatic activity.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In a hydroponic environment, seed can be grown hydroponically to full growth in roughly 5-7 days depending upon elevation, added nutrients, irrigation, lighting, etc. External application of ROS can influence the phytohormone balance within higher plants, favoring gibberellin synthesis. Through influencing the phytohormone balance during germination, enzymatic activity, stored nutrient mobilization, and dry matter accumulation is favorably increased.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The external ROS application system <b>10</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>8</b>-<b>12</b></figref> may include of a plurality of vertical members <b>12</b> and a plurality of horizontal members <b>14</b> removably interconnected to form an upstanding seed growing table <b>16</b> with one or more holding containers <b>58</b>. In some aspects of the present disclosure, the ROS application system <b>10</b> may have one or more seed growing tables and one or more holding containers <b>58</b>. Each vertical member <b>12</b> may be configured to terminate at the bottom in an adjustable height foot <b>20</b>. Each foot <b>20</b> may be adjusted to change the relative vertical position or height of one vertical member <b>12</b> relative to another vertical number <b>12</b> of the seed growing table <b>16</b>. The horizontal member <b>14</b> may be configured to include one or more lateral members removably interconnected with one or more longitudinal members <b>24</b>. A pair of vertical members <b>12</b> may be separated laterally by a lateral member <b>22</b> thereby defining the width or depth of the seed growing table <b>16</b>. Longitudinal members <b>24</b> may be removably interconnected with lateral members <b>22</b> by one or more connectors <b>26</b>. The ROS application system may be configured to apply at least one ROS to a plurality of seeds housed in the holding container <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Through the application of ROS in hydroponic environments, the oxidative mode of action of gibberellins is mimicked in vivo supporting the release of hydrolytic enzymes from the aleurone layer and other plant cellular tissues. In addition, ligninolytic enzyme such as peroxidases favor delignification pathways when ROS are present in contrast to lignification reactions when ROS are absent. Delignification facilitated by ligninolytic enzyme hydrolysis supports improved fiber digestibility as lignin is generally regarded as the most complex and indigestible fiber complex in higher plants. The external ROS increases the amount of dry matter of hydroponically grown cellulosic materials and maximizes enzyme activity. In higher plants, enzyme release during the germination process is commonly controlled by the release of gibberellic acid (GA) from the embryo. Prior to photosynthesis, the rate of GA released is positively correlated to the metabolic needs of the juvenile plants. Larger metabolic needs signal increased rates of the release of gibberellic acid. By using a system and method that provides external application of ROS to the plant or the seed, the hypoxic conditions are limited, and the efficiency of cellular respirations is maximized. The lignin peroxidase is energetically favored towards lignin deconstructive pathways rather than lignification.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">ROS are a type of unstable molecule that contains oxygen that can easily react with other molecules, such as a seed's coat, pathogens, or molecules within the cell. ROS can be formed due to the electron receptivity of O<sub>2</sub>. ROS have important roles in functions such as important signaling molecules that regulate normal plant growth, and responses to stress. ROS are involved in photoprotection and a plant or seed's tolerance to different types of stress. However, too much ROS can cause damage to DNA, RNA, or other molecules as they oxidize, in some cases preventing cellular functions. Oxygen toxicity can arise both from uncontrolled production and form the inefficient elimination of ROS by antioxidants. During times of environmental stress such as UV exposure, heat exposure, drought, salinity, chilling, defense from pathogens, nutrient deficiency or other types of environmental stressors ROS levels can naturally increase. ROS can include hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), hydroxyl radicals (OH), hypochlorous acid (HOCL), nitric acid (NO), peroxyl radical, including both alkylperoxyl and hydroperoxyl (ROO, R may be an H), peroxynitrite anion (ONOO<sup>&#x2212;</sup>), oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub>), peroxide (O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2212;2</sup>). H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is moderately reactive and has a relatively long half-life allowing it to diffuse some distances from the original release site or site of production.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Internal ROS production in plants is mainly found in the chloroplast, mitochondria and peroxisomes, but can also be found in the endoplasmic reticulum, cell membrane, cell wall and apoplast. The chloroplast photosystems, PSI and PSII, are major sources of internal ROS production. Abiotic stress factors lead to the formation of ROS through the Mehler reaction or the Fenton reaction and subsequently convert the O<sup>&#x2022;&#x2212;</sup><sub>2 </sub>into H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In the mitochondria, ROS are produced during normal conditions, but production is greatly increased by abiotic stress conditions. Peroxisomes are major sites of ROS production due to their oxidative metabolism. During stressful conditions, when the availability of water is low and stomata remains closed, increased photorespiration leads to glycolate formation. The glycolate is oxidized by glycolate oxidase in peroxisome to release H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, making it the leading producer of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>during photorespiration. At times of adverse environmental conditions, stress signals combined with abscisic acid (ABA) make the apoplast a prominent site for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>production inducing stomatal closure. The cell membrane provides information necessary for the survival of the plant cell. The electron transport system of the endoplasmic reticulum generates local ROS.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">External ROS are ROS that are not internally produced by the plant or seed. External ROS can be externally applied to the plant or the seed of the plant by an applicator or introduced through a plant growing surface or soil. The external ROS can include a single type of ROS, such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, or a plurality of types of ROS, such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x2212;2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The accumulation of internal and external ROS within a plant, seed, or a cell leads to a variety of cellular responses. Plant responses may be ROS dose dependent. ROS allow for vital hormone balance. ROS can act as plant signalers, can cross bio membranes, and may inactivate or activate enzymes. Therefore, a controlled amount of ROS introduced to the plant may be necessary. ROS may oxidize ABA making ABA inactive. ROS may do so by activating GA, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">ROS may interact with the outside chemistry of the seed or cell wall. Some seeds have a waxy outer coating which may contain chemicals or physical barriers that prevent germination or prevent water from entering the seed. Seeds with a waxy outer layer may include cereal grains such as wheat, barley, and rye. In some aspects, the O<sub>2 </sub>component of the ROS reacts with the cell wall or outer layer of the seed coat causing the cell wall or waxy outer layer to weaken, loosen or bubble thereby softening the cell wall. The ROS may even break the seed coat or cell wall open. ROS can also break down a cell wall by mediating poly saccharide deterioration and activating calcium channels and mitogen-activated protein kinases, enlarging and loosening the cell wall and causing weak points in the cell wall. External ROS can be introduced into a seed's environment to create weak spots in the seed coat allowing water to enter the seed more quickly. This may help the seed begin germinating. The creation of weak spots by the external ROS causes the seed to release additional internal ROS within the seed which interact with the interior of the cell wall or seed coat further weakening the wall. In the absence of ROS, the cell wall is strengthened and dormancy may continue.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The external introduction of ROS can jumpstart a seed's germination and end dormancy. ROS action during seed germination, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, is based on interactions between phytohormones that regulated seed dormancy or seed germination such as ABA, GA, and ethylene (ET). ABA inhibits ROS-mediated effects on seed germination by the promotion of ROS scavenging enzyme activity. The ratio of ABA and GA regulates seed dormancy, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. High ABA/GA ratios favor dormancy, whereas low ABA/GA ratios result in seed germination. High ABA/GA ratios can be counteracted by the controlled introduction of additional external ROS into the soil or growing surface or directly onto the seed or plant. The ROS are absorbed by the seed or plant. GA can also counteract the ROS-scavenging enzymes by downregulating the enzymes. The ROS can also oxidize ABA as well, decreasing the amount of ABA to GA. In some cases, ROS can release seed dormancy by activating GA signaling and synthesis rather than the repression of ABA signaling or ABA catabolism. GA synthesis can induce additional ROS production in seeds. ROS then subsequently acts as a signal molecule to antagonize ABA signaling. External ROS can increase internal ROS content of a seed synthesizing or activating additional GA or repression of more ABA signals. The external application of ROS decreases ABA levels and increases GA concentrations, which triggers seed germination. However, the amount or concentration of ROS may need to be monitored. Above certain limits, ROS are either too low to allow germination or too high and affect embryo viability and therefore prevent or delay germination. This creates an &#x2018;oxidative window&#x2019; for germination that restricts proficient seedling development within certain borders of increased ROS levels.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">During germination, GA translocates to the aleurone layer. &#x3b1;-amylase synthesis is triggered when GA interacts with the aleurone layer of the seed, thereby releasing or synthesizing hydrolytic enzymes, included &#x3b1;-amylase. The aleurone is located at the periphery of the starchy endosperm. The hydrolytic enzymes, such as 1,3; 1,4-&#x3b2;-glucanase (&#x3b2;-glucanase), &#x3b1;-amylase and &#x3b2;-amylase, are released to catalyse the breakdown of cell wall polysaccharides, proteases, storage proteins, and starchy energy reserves that are essential for germination, providing sugars that drive the root growth. &#x3b2;-glucanase may hydrolyse 1,3;1,4-&#x3b2;-glucan, a predominant cell wall polysaccharide. The &#x3b1;-amylase cleaves internal amylose and amylopectin residues. The &#x3b2;-amylase exo-hydrolase liberates maltose and glucose from the starch molecules. Without the repression of ABA by the introduction of external ROS, the ABA inhibits the transcription of hydrolytic enzymes, preventing germination.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In hydrated seeds under aerobic conditions, ROS production and external ROS application correlates to increased metabolism in chloroplasts, mitochondria, glyoxysomes, peroxisomes, and the plasma membrane. During seed imbibition, compartmentalization of ROS in different subcellular structures and their target molecule regulates the expression of various genes. Water allows ROS to be transported or to travel over greater distances whereas in dry seeds ROS production must be near targets during seed imbibition. When a seed or plant is hydrated, external ROS may easily translocate from outside the cell, seed, or plant to the interior of the cell, seed, or plant increasing enzyme activity and dry matter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> illustrates the germination percentage of barley over differing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentrations and salinity treatments. Salinity treatment expressed as salinity concentration in parts per thousand. The values shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> are expressed in a fixed effect linear model estimation with 95 percent confidence interval illustrating the surrounding estimate. Through the application of ROS, the inhibitory influence of ABA included reduced stem elongation and germination is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">During stress, the cell wall-localized lipoxygenase causes hydroperoxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) making it an active source of ROS. During a pathogen attack, lignin precursors undergo extensive cross-linking, via ROS-mediated pathways to reinforce the cell wall with lignin. Lignin fills the spaces in the cell wall between cellulose material, hemicellulose, and pectin components, especially in vascular and support tissues: xylem tracheids, vessel elements and sclereid cells. If external ROS are applied to the seed or plant, the external ROS may disinfect the seed or plant or kill some or all of the pathogens. This stops lignin precursors from cross-linking and strengthen the cell wall preventing germination or the growth of the plant.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The term &#x201c;cellulosic material&#x201d; means any material containing cellulose. The predominant polysaccharide in the primary cell wall of biomass is cellulose, the second most abundant is hemicellulose, and the third is pectin. The secondary cell wall, produced after the cell has stopped growing, also contains polysaccharides and is strengthened by polymeric lignin covalently cross-linked to hemicellulose. Cellulose is a homopolymer of anhydrocellobiose and thus a linear beta-(1-4)-D-glucan, while hemicelluloses include a variety of compounds, such as Xylans, Xyloglucans, arabinoxylans, and mannans in complex branched structures with a spectrum of Substituents. Although generally polymorphous, cellulose is found in plant tissue primarily as an insoluble crystalline matrix of parallel glucan chains. Hemicelluloses usually hydrogen bond to cellulose, as well as to other hemicelluloses, which help stabilize the cell wall matrix.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Lignin depolymerization can be achieved primarily by one-electron oxidation reactions catalyzed by extracellular oxidases and peroxidases in the presence of extracellular ROS or external ROS, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. Hydroxyl radicals attack the lignin structures, creating access points for hydrolysis by whole cells, enzymes, or other chemicals. External application of ROS allows additional ROS to attack the lignin structures, creating additional access points for hydrolysis lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose by ligninolytic enzymes, hemicellulolytic enzymes or hemicellulose, cellulolytic enzymes or cellulase, and endoglucanase.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Ligninolytic enzymes are an enzyme that hydrolyzes the structure of lignin polymers. Enzymes that can break down lignin include lignin peroxidases, manganese peroxidases, laccases and feruloyl esterases, and other enzymes described in the art known to depolymerize or otherwise break lignin polymers. Also included are enzymes capable of hydrolyzing bonds formed between hemicellulose sugars (notably arabinose) and lignin. Hemicellulolytic enzymes or hemicellulase are one or more enzymes that hydrolyze a hemicellulose material. Endoglucanases are an endo-1,4-(1,3:1,4}-beta-D-glucan 4-glucanohydrolase (E.C. 3.2.1.4) that catalyzes endohydrolysis of 1,4-beta-Dglycosidic linkages in cellulose, cellulose derivatives (such as carboxymethyl cellulose and hydroxyethyl cellulose), lichenin, beta-1,4 bonds in mixed beta-1,3 glucans such as cereal beta-D-glucans or Xyloglucans, and other plant material containing cellulosic components. Cellulolytic enzymes or cellulase are means one or more enzymes that hydrolyze a cellulosic material. Such enzymes include endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases, beta-glucosidases, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The ROS may oxidize the pericarp of a plant ovary. The pericarp is the ripened and variously modified walls of a plant ovary. The pericarp has an outer exocarp, a central mesocarp, and an inner endocarp, and this is the wall of a plant fruit that develops from the ovary wall. External ROS may trigger redox signaling during plant organ development including fruit ripening and flower development. Oxidative stress, the imbalance between ROS production and ROS elimination, occurs in the mitochondria due to increased respiratory rates during ripening affecting the redox state once sugars become a limiting factor and onset ripening. External ROS can increase the imbalance allowing the plant to ripen. Oxidative stress also occurs in the plastid during the chloroplast to chromoplast transition at the onset of fruit ripening.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">At the beginning of the seed out phase, ROS can be introduced to the seed's environment to disinfect the seed, the growing material the seed will be planted in, and the growing surface <b>18</b> for housing the growing material, such as a seed belt, a hydroponic grower, or a pan system, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>8</b>-<b>12</b></figref>. The growing surface <b>18</b> may include a top surface for hydroponically growing the plurality of seeds atop of the growing surface. The ROS kills harmful bacteria, mold or fungi growing on the seed, the growing material or the growing surface while preventing good bacteria present in the seed from being destroyed during the disinfection process. By killing the harmful bacterial, mold, or fungi using the ROS, beneficial or helpful bacteria can grow in the growth material or on the seed. The material of the growing surface <b>18</b> may be designed to help maintain an oxidative environment. For example, the bottom or sides of the growing surface <b>18</b> may be hydrophobic, permeable, or semipermeable. In some aspects of the present disclosure, the growing surface <b>18</b> may be disinfected by the ROS prior to the seed out phase. The seeds may also be cleaned or exposed to the ROS to be disinfected in a seed cleaner <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>7</b></figref>, prior to entering the growing surface or as they enter the growing surface.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Often raw or bulk seed contains debris and other contaminants, and seed cleaner <b>30</b> may remove debris and contaminants from seed before conveying seed to the growing surface <b>18</b> or the framework <b>12</b>. Seed cleaner <b>30</b> may include a separator housing <b>32</b> having a seed inlet <b>34</b>, seed discharge <b>36</b>, and disposed between seed inlet <b>34</b> and seed discharge <b>36</b>, and may include one or more augers <b>38</b> disposed vertically within conduit <b>40</b> having a diameter of the flighting <b>42</b>. Flighting <b>42</b> may be preferably non-continuous thereby leaving gaps between intermittently spaced sections of fighting for seed, debris, and contaminants to freefall from one level of fighting onto the next level of fighting. A vacuum line <b>44</b> may be operably connected at or near seed inlet <b>34</b> and connected at an opposing end to a vacuum source. Seed may be introduced into seed cleaner <b>30</b> through seed inlet <b>34</b> and descend fighting <b>42</b> and freefall between gaps in flighting <b>42</b> on each auger <b>38</b>. Debris and contaminants may be sucked into vacuum line <b>44</b> and the seed may descend through seed discharge free of the debris and contaminants that are suctioned off into a refuse container. The cleaned seed may exit seed discharge <b>36</b> and be conveyed or placed on the growing surface <b>18</b>. In some instances, seed may include larger debris that cannot be suctioned off without suctioning off seed too. A screen (not shown) can be operably disposed at the exit of seed discharge <b>36</b> to screen off larger debris that is not suctioned off while passing through seed cleaner <b>30</b>. One or more plumbing elements may be operably configured to disinfect seed within a seed cleaner with a ROS applicator. One or more UV lighting elements can be operably configured to irradiate seed within seed cleaner <b>30</b> with UV light to kill bacteria on seed. The process of cleaning seed with seed cleaner <b>30</b>, irradiating seed with UV light, and the general operation of seed cleaner <b>30</b>, can be automated by a controller, graphical user interface, and/or remote control.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Each growing surface <b>18</b> may include a liquid applicator <b>46</b>A, <b>46</b>B, and/or <b>46</b>C operably configured atop each growing surface <b>18</b> for irrigating seed disposed atop each growing surface <b>18</b>. The dimensions of the growing surface <b>18</b> may be configured to accommodate need, desired plant output, or ROS application coverage. Liquid applicator <b>46</b>A may be configured adjacent at least one longitudinal edge of growing surface <b>18</b>. Liquid applicator <b>46</b>A may also be operably configured adjacent at least one lateral edge of growing surface <b>18</b>. Preferably, liquid applicator <b>46</b>A may be configured adjacent a longitudinal edge of growing surface <b>18</b> to thereby provide drip-flood irrigation to growing surface <b>18</b> and seed disposed atop growing surface <b>18</b>. Liquid applicator <b>46</b>A may include a ROS guide <b>48</b> and ROS distributor <b>50</b>A, <b>50</b>B, <b>50</b>C with a ROS egress <b>52</b> having a generally undulated profile, such as a sawtooth or wavy profile generally providing peak (higher elevated) and valley (lower elevated) portions. Liquid applicator <b>46</b>A can include a ROS line <b>54</b> configured to carry ROS from a ROS source <b>56</b>, such as a ROS collector <b>58</b> or plumbed ROS source <b>56</b>. ROS may exit ROS line <b>54</b> through one or more openings and may be captured upon exiting ROS line <b>54</b> by ROS guide <b>48</b> and ROS distributor <b>50</b>A. The one or more openings in ROS line <b>54</b> can be configured as ROS drippers, intermittently dripping a known or quantifiable amount of ROS over a set timeframe into ROS guide <b>48</b>. The one or more openings may be configured intermittently along a length of ROS line <b>54</b> or dispersed in groupings along a length of ROS line <b>54</b>. The one or more openings in ROS line <b>54</b> can be operably configured to equally distribute the ROS down the growing surface <b>18</b> and slowly drip liquid into the growing surface <b>18</b>. Drip or flood irrigating the growing surface provides a layer of ROS <b>62</b> for soaking the seed and can provide liquid to seed on growing surface <b>18</b> in a controlled, even distributive flow. ROS distributor <b>50</b>A can be configured with a ROS guide <b>48</b> adapted to collect liquid as it exits ROS line <b>54</b>. Collected ROS may be evenly distributed by ROS distributor <b>50</b>A and exit the ROS distributor <b>50</b>A onto the growing surface <b>18</b> via the ROS egress <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to at least one aspect, ROS egressing from ROS distributor <b>50</b>A may travel atop growing surface <b>18</b> beneath and/or between a seed mass atop growing surface <b>18</b>. Other configurations of liquid applicator <b>46</b> are also contemplated herein. For example, in one aspect, ROS may enter liquid applicator <b>46</b> through a ROS line <b>54</b> and exit ROS line <b>54</b> through a plurality of openings. ROS from ROS line <b>54</b> may coalesce into a small reservoir creating a balanced distribution of liquid across a length of ROS distributor <b>50</b>A. When this small reservoir becomes full the ROS may run over and out of ROS egress <b>52</b>, such as between the teeth of ROS egress <b>52</b>. In this manner, ROS may be equally distributed down an entire length and across an entire width of the growing surface. From ROS egress <b>52</b>, ROS may drip onto a growing surface <b>18</b> where it may run under a bulk of seed on the growing surface <b>18</b> to soak or make contact with the seed. The root system of seed on growing surface <b>18</b>, along with a wicking effect, may move the ROS up through the seed to water all the seeds and/or plants.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Liquid applicator <b>46</b>B may be disposed atop each growing surface <b>18</b>. Liquid applicator <b>46</b>B may include a plurality of ROS distributors <b>50</b>B operably configured in a ROS line <b>54</b> operably plumbed to a ROS source <b>56</b>. ROS distributor <b>50</b>B can include spray heads, such as single or dual-band spray heads/tips, for spray irrigating seed disposed atop each growing surface <b>18</b>. In one aspect, a plurality of ROS lines <b>54</b> may be disposed in a spaced arrangement atop each growing surface <b>18</b>. Each ROS line <b>54</b> may traverse the length of the holding container and may be plumbed into connection with ROS source <b>56</b>. Other ROS lines <b>54</b> can be configured to traverse the width of growing surface <b>18</b>. ROS may be discharged from each ROS distributor <b>50</b>B for spray irrigating seed atop each growing surface <b>18</b>. In another aspect, each ROS line <b>54</b> may be oscillated back and forth over a 10&#xb0;, 15&#xb0;, 20&#xb0;, 25&#xb0;, 30&#xb0;, 35&#xb0;, 40&#xb0;, 45&#xb0;, or greater radius of travel for covering the entire surface area of the seed atop each growing surface <b>18</b>. In the case where dual angle spray heads are used for ROS distributor <b>50</b>B, the oscillation travel of each ROS line <b>54</b> can be reduced thereby reducing friction and wear and tear on liquid applicator <b>46</b>B. The process of applying ROS to the seed or plant can be automated by a controller, graphical user interface, and/or remote control. A drive mechanism <b>66</b> can be operably connected to each ROS line <b>54</b> for oscillating or rotating each line through a radius of travel. Liquid applicator <b>46</b> can be operated manually or automatically using one or more controllers operated by a control system.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Liquid applicator <b>46</b> may be configured to clean growing surface <b>18</b> of debris, contaminants, mold, fungi, bacteria, and other foreign/unwanted materials. Liquid applicator <b>46</b> can also be used to irrigate seed with a disinfectant or ROS as seed is released onto growing surface <b>18</b> from a seed dispenser. A time delay can be used to allow the ROS to remain on seed for a desired time before applying or irrigating with fresh water. The process of cleaning, descaling, and disinfecting growing surface <b>18</b> using liquid applicator <b>46</b>D can be automated by a controller, graphical user interface, and/or remote control.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Liquid applicator <b>46</b> can be operated immediately after seeding of the growing surface <b>18</b> to saturate seed with ROS. Seed in early, mid, and late stages of growth can be irrigated with ROS using liquid applicator <b>46</b>. Liquid applicators <b>46</b>A-D can be operated simultaneously, intermittently, alternately, and independent of each other. During early stages of seed growth, both liquid applicators <b>46</b>A-B are operated to best saturate seed to promote sprouting and germination. During later stages of growth, liquid applicator <b>46</b>A can be used to irrigate more than liquid applicator <b>46</b>B. Alternatively, liquid applicator <b>46</b>B can be used to irrigate more than liquid applicator <b>46</b>A, depending upon saturation level of seed growth. Liquid applicator <b>46</b>C can be operated during seeding of growing surface <b>18</b> and movement of growing surface <b>18</b> in the second direction to spray seed dispensed atop growing surface <b>18</b> to saturate seed with ROS. ROS provided to liquid applicators <b>46</b>A-D could include additives, such as disinfectants and/or nutrients. Nutrients, such as commonly known plant nutrients, can be added to ROS dispensed from liquid applicators <b>46</b>A-D to promote growth of healthy plants and/or increase the presence of desired nutrients in harvested seed. Liquid applicators <b>46</b>C-D can be used also to sanitize growing surface <b>18</b> before and/or after winding on or unwinding of the seed belt, the growing surface <b>18</b>, or atop of the growing surface <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Liquid distributors <b>46</b>A-D and their various components, along with other components of external ROS application system <b>10</b>, can be sanitized by including one or more disinfectants, such as ROS used by each ROS distributor <b>50</b>A-D.

In another aspect, liquid applicators <b>46</b>A-D can be used to clean and sanitize growing surface <b>18</b> before, between, or after seeding and harvesting. A separate liquid distributor or manifold can be configured to disinfect or sanitize any components of the growing system that carry ROS for irrigation and cutting or receive irrigation or cutting runoff from the one or more holding containers.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In one aspect of the application of ROS, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>13</b></figref>, the ROS may be applied to disinfect the plurality of seeds (Step <b>200</b>). Next, the plurality of seeds may be placed on a growing surface (Step <b>202</b>) during a seed out phase. In some aspects of the present disclosure, the seeds may be disinfected after being placed on the growing surface. Next, at least one ROS may be applied to the plurality of seeds on the growing surface (Step <b>204</b>) during the seed out phase. The external ROS may be constantly applied, or the applicator may apply the ROS at a set time frame or at a quantifiable amount. For example, the liquid applicator may apply the ROS for a first time period such as 1 minute and then the liquid applicator may stop applying the ROS for a second time period, such as 4 minutes, or 1 min of ROS application for every 5 minutes. Next the plurality of seeds may germinate (Step <b>206</b>). Next, the ROS may be applied to the germinated plurality of seeds during a plant development phase (Step <b>208</b>). Lastly, the germinated plurality of seeds may mature (Step <b>210</b>). The ROS can be applied at a specific concentration during both seed out and plant development phases.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In another aspect of the application of ROS, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>14</b></figref>, the ROS may be applied to disinfect the plurality of seeds (Step <b>300</b>). Next, the plurality of seeds may be placed on a growing surface (Step <b>302</b>) during a seed out phase. In some aspects of the present disclosure, the seeds may be disinfected after being placed on the growing surface. At seed out the ROS can be applied at a first concentration, such as a concentration ranging from 1000-3000 ppm (Step <b>304</b>). Next the seed out phase may terminate (Step <b>306</b>). The seed out phase may last 18 to 24 hours. However, the seed out phase may be shorter or longer than 18 to 24 hours. Moisture levels during seed out may range from 10-60 percent, however the moisture levels may be higher or lower. After the seed out phase terminates, ROS may be applied at a second concentration rate, such as 50-200 ppm, throughout plant development until the plant matures (Step <b>308</b>). A higher rate during the seed out phase may promote the inactivation of biological contaminants present on the seed coat including bacterial contamination and fungal spores, pericarp oxidation, and initial hydrogen peroxide uptake. The higher rate of ROS application creates weak spots in the seed coat allowing the seed to increase water intake, and the intake of the external ROS by the seed increases the production of GA and decreases the amount of ABA or ABA signaling. The decrease in environmental stress of the seed and the increase in GA allow the seed to start germination. Lastly the seed or plurality of seed may mature and be ready to be harvested (Step <b>310</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">After the initiation of metabolic activity, a lower rate may be needed. Reduced rates throughout development support continue abscisic acid oxidation thereby increasing the release of gibberellins throughout plant development. A lower rate for an extended period is believed to mimic the value of a high rate for a reduced duration. As the plant grows, the root systems provide a wicking effect, aiding in the distribution of the external ROS. The absence of hydrogen peroxide may result in lower performance, lower feed value, and lower quality of overall development of the plant product. In some aspects of the present disclosure, the ROS may be applied at a first concentration during a soaking period. The soaking period may last for 10 minutes or 15 minutes. A lower rate for an extended soaking period may have the value of a high rate for a reduced duration. For example, the seed may be exposed to 200/300 ppm of ROS for a duration of 10 minutes during the soaking period. After the soaking period, the application of ROS may switch to a maintenance rate which may be 50-200 ppm throughout development.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">During the application processes, the ROS may be applied by liquid applicator <b>46</b> as a liquid concentration. The application may include flood irrigation, drip irrigation, spray irrigation, subirrigation, or any other irrigation method that allows the ROS to reach the seed or the plant. The liquid applicator <b>46</b> may apply the ROS at a set time frame or at a quantifiable amount. For example, the liquid applicator <b>46</b> may apply the ROS for a first time period, such as 1 minute, and then the liquid applicator <b>46</b> may stop applying the ROS for a second time period, such as 4 minutes, or 1 min of ROS application for every 5 minutes. The cycle may continue until the developmental phase or seed out phase terminates. In another example, the ROS may be applied for 1 min every 2 hours. The liquid applicator <b>46</b> may provide a controlled, evenly distributed flow allowing the ROS to reach a maximum number of seeds. Excess ROS may be captured, recycled, and reused by the external ROS application system <b>10</b>. If the growing surface <b>18</b> has an egress or a slant, the slant may aid in the even distribution of the ROS as it egresses through the holding container. In some aspects, the liquid applicator <b>46</b> may guide the distribution of the ROS to areas within the holding container, a portion of the seeds, or a portion of the plants that need more application. The liquid applicators <b>46</b> may also oscillate to cover the larger areas of the growing surface <b>18</b> or the entire length and width of the growing surface <b>18</b> or seed bed.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">ROS may be applied separately from other liquids that are being supplied to the growing system. The ROS may be mixed with another liquid, such as water, an alkaline solution, or fertilizer, prior to distribution by the liquid applicator <b>46</b>. The liquid applicator may have a plurality of nozzles for liquid distribution, each responsible for distributing one or more type of liquid. For example, a ROS nozzle and water nozzle may be converging nozzles and the ROS and water may be discharged simultaneously onto the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In another aspect of the application of ROS to increase dry matter, the plurality of seeds may be placed on a growing surface (Step <b>400</b>). Next, a first reactive oxygen species of a plurality of reactive oxygen species may be introduced by a liquid applicator on to the growing surface at a first concentration for a first time period (Step <b>402</b>). Next, the plurality of seeds may be disinfected by the first reactive oxygen species of a plurality of reactive oxygen species introduced by the liquid applicator (Step <b>404</b>). In some aspects of the present disclosure, the seeds may be disinfected after being placed on the growing surface. Next, the plurality of seeds may germinate on the growing surface (Step <b>406</b>). Next, a second reactive oxygen species of a plurality of reactive oxygen species may be discharged by the liquid applicator at a second concentration for a second time period (Step <b>408</b>). In some aspects, different concentrations of ROS may be used during different stages of plant development or if it is determined that the plant or seed needs additional ROS to increase dry matter.
