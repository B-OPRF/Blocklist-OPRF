<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to agricultural implements and, more particularly, to systems and methods for determining a trip magnitude of a ground-engaging tool of an agricultural implement.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is well known that, to attain the best agricultural performance from a field, a farmer must cultivate the soil, typically by performing a tillage operation. Modern farmers perform tillage operations by pulling a tillage implement behind an agricultural work vehicle, such as a tractor. Tillage implements typically include a plurality of ground-engaging tools configured to penetrate the soil to a particular depth. In this respect, the ground-engaging tools may be rotatably coupled to a frame of the tillage implement. In many instances, biasing elements, such as springs, are used to exert biasing forces on the ground-engaging tools. This configuration may allow the ground-engaging tools to be biased towards a desired position relative to the frame, thereby maintaining the particular depth of soil penetration as the agricultural work vehicle pulls the tillage implement through the field. Additionally, this configuration may also permit the ground-engaging tools to rotate out of the way of rocks or other impediments in the soil, thereby preventing damage to the ground-engaging tools or other components on the implement.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Frequent tripping of the ground-engaging tools may result in uneven compaction mitigation. However, it is difficult for an operator to determine why a trip is occurring during a tillage operation. In some instances, knowing at least a magnitude of the trip would help identify the reason for the trips.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, an improved agricultural system and method for determining a trip magnitude of a ground-engaging tool of an agricultural implement would be welcomed in the technology.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Aspects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the following description, or may be obvious from the description, or may be learned through practice of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, the present subject matter is directed to a system for automatically determining a trip magnitude of a ground engaging tool of an agricultural implement. The system may include a ground-engaging system having an attachment structure coupled to a frame of an agricultural implement, a ground-engaging tool rotatably coupled to the attachment structure at a joint, and a biasing element configured to bias the ground-engaging tool towards a predetermined ground-engaging position. The system may further include a trip sensor configured to generate data indicative of a magnitude of rotation of the ground-engaging tool, with the trip sensor being at least partially received within the biasing element.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Reference now will be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the invention. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment can be used with another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In general, the present subject matter is directed to systems and methods for determining a trip magnitude of a ground-engaging tool of an agricultural implement. Specifically, in several embodiments, the disclosed system may be used to determine the magnitude of rotation of a ground-engaging tool of a ground-engaging system about a joint coupling the ground-engaging tool relative to a frame of an agricultural implement. For instance, the disclosed system may include a trip sensor, such as a Hall-effect sensor and magnet or a linear potentiometer, that is at least partially received within a biasing element configured to bias the ground-engaging tool towards a predetermined ground-engaging position. The trip sensor is configured to generate data indicative of a magnitude of rotation of the ground-engaging tool such that a computing system of the disclosed system may be configured to receive the data from the trip sensor and, in turn, determine a magnitude of the rotation or &#x201c;trip&#x201d; of the ground-engaging tool. The computing system may further be configured to initiate a control action based at least in part on the magnitude of the trip. By particularly positioning the trip sensor at least partially within the biasing element, the trip sensor is better protected from dirt and debris during an agricultural operation with the agricultural implement that may otherwise damage the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> illustrate differing perspective views of one embodiment of an agricultural implement <b>10</b> in accordance with aspects of the present subject matter. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of the agricultural implement <b>10</b> coupled to a work vehicle <b>12</b>. Additionally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of the implement <b>10</b>, particularly illustrating various components of the implement <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In general, the implement <b>10</b> may be configured to be towed across a field in a direction of travel (e.g., as indicated by arrow <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) by the work vehicle <b>12</b>. As shown, the implement <b>10</b> may be configured as a tillage implement, and the work vehicle <b>12</b> may be configured as an agricultural tractor. However, in other embodiments, the implement <b>10</b> may be configured as any other suitable type of implement, such as a seed-planting implement, a fertilizer-dispensing implement, and/or the like. Similarly, the work vehicle <b>12</b> may be configured as any other suitable type of vehicle, such as an agricultural harvester, a self-propelled sprayer, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the work vehicle <b>12</b> may include a pair of front track assemblies <b>16</b>, a pair or rear track assemblies <b>18</b>, and a frame or chassis <b>20</b> coupled to and supported by the track assemblies <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. An operator's cab <b>22</b> may be supported by a portion of the chassis <b>20</b> and may house various input devices for permitting an operator to control the operation of one or more components of the work vehicle <b>12</b> and/or one or more components of the implement <b>10</b>. Additionally, as is generally understood, the work vehicle <b>12</b> may include an engine <b>24</b> and a transmission <b>26</b> mounted on the chassis <b>20</b>. The transmission <b>26</b> may be operably coupled to the engine <b>24</b> and may provide variably adjusted gear ratios for transferring engine power to the track assemblies <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> via a drive axle assembly (not shown) (or via axles if multiple drive axles are employed).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the implement <b>10</b> may include a frame <b>28</b>. More specifically, the frame <b>28</b> may extend longitudinally between a forward end <b>30</b> and an aft end <b>32</b>. The frame <b>28</b> may also extend laterally between a first side <b>34</b> and a second side <b>36</b>. In this respect, the frame <b>28</b> generally includes a plurality of structural frame members <b>38</b>, such as beams, bars, and/or the like, configured to support or couple to a plurality of components. Furthermore, a hitch assembly <b>40</b> may be connected to the frame <b>28</b> and configured to couple the implement <b>10</b> to the work vehicle <b>12</b>. Additionally, a plurality of wheels <b>42</b> (one of which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>) may be coupled to the frame <b>28</b> to facilitate towing the implement <b>10</b> in the direction of travel <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In several embodiments, one or more ground-engaging tools may be coupled to and/or supported by the frame <b>28</b>. More particularly, in certain embodiments, the ground-engaging tools may include one or more shanks <b>50</b> and/or one or more disc blades <b>46</b> supported relative to the frame <b>28</b>. In one embodiment, each shank <b>50</b> and/or disc blade <b>46</b> may be individually supported relative to the frame <b>28</b>. Alternatively, one or more groups or sections of the ground-engaging tools may be ganged together to form one or more ganged tool assemblies, such as the disc gang assemblies <b>44</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, each disc gang assembly <b>44</b> includes a toolbar <b>48</b> coupled to the implement frame <b>28</b> and a plurality of disc blades <b>46</b> supported by the toolbar <b>48</b> relative to the implement frame <b>28</b>. Each disc blade <b>46</b> may, in turn, be configured to penetrate into or otherwise engage the soil as the implement <b>10</b> is being pulled through the field. As is generally understood, the various disc gang assemblies <b>44</b> may be oriented at an angle relative to the direction of travel <b>14</b> to promote more effective tilling of the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It should be appreciated that, in addition to the shanks <b>50</b> and the disc blades <b>46</b>, the implement frame <b>28</b> may be configured to support any other suitable ground-engaging tools. For instance, in the illustrated embodiment, the frame <b>28</b> is also configured to support a plurality of leveling blades <b>52</b> and rolling (or crumbler) basket assemblies <b>54</b>. In other embodiments, any other suitable ground-engaging tools may be coupled to and supported by the implement frame <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It should be appreciated that the configuration of the implement <b>10</b> described above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> is provided only to place the present subject matter in an exemplary field of use. Thus, it should be appreciated that the present subject matter may be readily adaptable to any manner of implement configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, side-views of a shank assembly including one of the shanks <b>50</b> of the tillage implement <b>10</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> is illustrated in accordance with aspects of the present subject matter, particularly illustrating the shank assembly in a non-tripped position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> and in a tripped position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>. As shown in the illustrated embodiment, the shank assembly includes the shank <b>50</b> and an associated attachment structure <b>60</b> for rotatably coupling the shank <b>50</b> to the implement frame <b>28</b> (e.g., about a first joint <b>66</b>). More particularly, the attachment structure <b>60</b> includes a first attachment member <b>61</b>, a second attachment member <b>62</b>, and a third attachment member <b>64</b>. The first attachment member <b>61</b> is fixed to the implement frame <b>28</b> (e.g., to frame member <b>38</b>). A first end of the second attachment member <b>62</b> is rotatably coupled to the first attachment member <b>61</b> at the first joint <b>66</b>. The third attachment member <b>64</b> is fixed to a second end of the second attachment member <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The shank <b>50</b> extends between a proximal or tip end <b>50</b>A and a distal end <b>50</b>B, with the shank <b>50</b> being rotatably coupled to the attachment structure <b>60</b> (e.g., to the third attachment member <b>64</b>) of the shank assembly at a second joint <b>70</b> proximate the distal end <b>50</b>B. As such, the shank <b>50</b> may rotate about the second joint <b>70</b> relative to the frame <b>28</b> independent of the rotation about the first point <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>, the shank assembly may include a shear bolt or pin <b>72</b> (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;the shear pin <b>72</b>&#x201d;) for preventing rotation of the shank <b>50</b> about the second joint <b>70</b> during normal operation of the tillage implement. For instance, the shear pin <b>72</b> at least partially extends through both the attachment structure <b>60</b> (e.g., through third attachment member <b>64</b>) and the shank <b>50</b> at a location spaced apart from the second joint <b>70</b>. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the shear pin <b>72</b> is received within openings formed above the second joint <b>70</b> in the attachment member <b>64</b> and the shank <b>50</b>. However, the shear pin <b>72</b> may be positioned at any other suitable location relative to the second joint <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Additionally, in several embodiments, the shank assembly may include a biasing element <b>74</b> for biasing the shank <b>50</b> towards a predetermined ground-engaging tool position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) relative to the frame <b>28</b>. In general, the shank <b>50</b> is configured to penetrate the soil to a desired depth when the shank <b>50</b> is in the predetermined ground-engaging tool position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>). In operation, the biasing element <b>74</b> may permit relative movement between the shank <b>50</b> and the frame <b>28</b>. For example, the biasing element <b>74</b> may be configured to bias the shank <b>50</b> (and the attachment structure <b>60</b>) to rotate relative to the frame <b>28</b> in a first direction (e.g., as indicated by arrow <b>76</b>) toward the predetermined ground-engaging tool position. The biasing element <b>74</b> also allows the shank <b>50</b> (and the attachment structure <b>60</b>) to rotate away from the predetermined ground-engaging tool position (e.g., to a shallower depth of penetration or out of the ground), such as in a second direction (e.g., as indicated by arrow <b>78</b>) opposite the first direction <b>76</b>, toward a tripped ground-engaging tool position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, when encountering rocks or other impediments in the field.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the embodiment shown, the biasing element <b>74</b> is configured as a coil spring. However, it should be appreciated that the biasing element <b>74</b> may be configured as any other suitable biasing element. As will be described in greater detail below, a guide <b>73</b> extends longitudinally through the coil spring <b>74</b> to limit the lateral movement of the coil spring <b>74</b> as the coil spring <b>74</b> compresses and extends. A cap <b>75</b> is slidably received on the guide <b>73</b> and is rotatably coupled to the shank <b>50</b>, particularly to the third attachment member <b>64</b>. The coil spring <b>74</b> is compressible between the cap <b>75</b> and the first attachment member <b>61</b>. Particularly, during a tillage operation, the tip end <b>50</b>A of the shank <b>50</b> may encounter impediments in the field causing the shank assembly to rotate about the first joint <b>66</b> in the second direction <b>78</b> to allow the shank assembly to clear or pass over the impediment. As the shank <b>50</b> rotates away from the predetermined ground-engaging position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> towards the tripped ground-engaging tool position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, the cap <b>75</b> slides along the guide <b>73</b> and compresses the coil spring <b>74</b>. As such, the compression of the coil spring <b>74</b> is indicative of a magnitude of a trip of the shank <b>50</b>. Once the impediment is cleared, to return the shank <b>50</b> to the predetermined ground-engaging position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the coil spring <b>74</b> applies a spring force against the cap <b>75</b> to slide the cap <b>75</b> along the guide <b>73</b> to rotate the shank <b>50</b> back towards the predetermined ground-engaging position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>. The spring force is a function of the compression of the coil spring <b>74</b> from a resting position associated with the predetermined ground-engaging position.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In accordance with aspects of the present subject matter, the shank assembly further includes a trip sensor <b>100</b> for monitoring tripping of the shank <b>50</b>. More particularly, data from the trip sensor <b>100</b> may be used to determine a magnitude of each trip of the shank <b>50</b>. For instance, in some embodiments, the trip sensor <b>100</b> may include a sensing portion <b>102</b>, such as a Hall-effect sensor or a linear potentiometer, configured to generate data indicative of a compression distance of the biasing element <b>74</b>, which in turn, is indicative of a magnitude of a trip event or rotation of the shank <b>50</b> about the joint <b>66</b>. In such embodiments, the trip sensor <b>100</b> also includes a sensed portion <b>104</b>, such as a magnet or arm, which is movable relative to the sensing portion <b>102</b>. The position of the sensed portion <b>104</b> relative to the sensing portion <b>102</b> is determined by the sensing portion <b>102</b> and is indicative of the magnitude of a trip event or rotation of the shank <b>50</b> about the joint <b>66</b>. One of the sensing portion <b>102</b> and the sensed portion <b>104</b> may be movable with the biasing element <b>74</b> (e.g., fixed to the cap <b>75</b> and/or the biasing element <b>74</b>) as the biasing element <b>74</b> is compressed or extended, while the other of the sensing portion <b>102</b> and the sensed portion <b>104</b> may be fixed relative to the biasing element <b>74</b> (e.g., fixed to the guide <b>73</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref>, various views of one embodiment of the trip sensor <b>100</b> for determining a trip magnitude of the shank <b>50</b> are illustrated in accordance with aspects of the present subject matter.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>, the guide <b>73</b> generally extends longitudinally between a first guide end <b>73</b>A and a second guide end <b>73</b>B, with the second guide end <b>73</b>B being rotatably coupled to the first attachment member <b>61</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>3</b> and <b>4</b></figref>) at a third joint <b>80</b>. The biasing element <b>74</b> similarly extends longitudinally between a first spring end <b>74</b>A and a second spring end <b>74</b>B. The guide <b>73</b> extends longitudinally within the biasing element <b>74</b> such that the first spring end <b>74</b>A is proximate or closer to the first guide end <b>73</b>A than the second guide end <b>73</b>B, and the second spring end <b>74</b>B is proximate or closer to the second guide end <b>73</b>B than the first guide end <b>73</b>A. The cap <b>75</b> also generally extends longitudinally between a first cap end <b>75</b>A and a second, open cap end <b>75</b>B. The cap <b>75</b> is slidably received on the guide <b>73</b>, and the first spring end <b>74</b>A of the biasing element <b>74</b> is positioned at the cap <b>75</b>. For instance, in one embodiment, the biasing element <b>74</b> extends through the second cap end <b>75</b>B of the cap <b>75</b> such that the first spring end <b>74</b>A of the biasing element <b>74</b> rests against the first cap end <b>75</b>A and the first cap end <b>75</b>A is generally between the first guide end <b>73</b>A and the first spring end <b>74</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b>-<b>7</b></figref>, in one embodiment, the sensing portion <b>102</b> is fixed relative to the biasing element <b>74</b> while the sensed portion <b>104</b> (e.g., a magnet) is movable with the biasing element <b>74</b>. Particularly, the sensing portion <b>102</b> is fixed to the guide <b>73</b> and the sensed portion <b>104</b> is fixed to the cap <b>75</b>. By arranging the trip sensor <b>100</b> at least partially within the biasing element <b>74</b>, the trip sensor <b>100</b> is protected from dirt and debris that may otherwise damage the trip sensor <b>100</b>. Further, by fixing the sensing portion <b>102</b> to the guide <b>73</b>, the sensing portion <b>102</b> is subject to less movement, which may reduce wear on the sensing portion <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When the shank <b>50</b> is in the predetermined ground-engaging position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>), the biasing element <b>74</b> extends across a first length L<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) between the first and second spring ends <b>74</b>A, <b>74</b>B, and the sensed portion <b>104</b> is at a first position relative to the sensing portion <b>102</b>. When the shank <b>50</b> is moved to the tripped position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>), the cap <b>75</b> slides from the first guide end <b>73</b>A towards the second guide end <b>73</b>B and compresses the biasing element <b>74</b> such that the biasing element <b>74</b> extends across a shorter, second length L<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) between the first and second spring ends <b>74</b>A, <b>74</b>B, and the sensed portion <b>104</b> is moved into a second position relative to the sensing portion <b>102</b>. Each rotational position of the shank <b>50</b> between the non-tripped and tripped positions may correspond to a different compression distance of the biasing element <b>74</b> and thus, a different position of the sensed portion <b>104</b> between the first and second positions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>5</b> and <b>6</b></figref>), which may correspond to a different output voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">For instance, in one embodiment, the sensed portion <b>104</b> is a bi-polar magnet having a first polar end P<b>1</b> and a second polar end P<b>2</b>, and the sensing portion <b>102</b> is a bi-polar Hall-effect sensor. As such, when the sensed portion <b>104</b> is at the first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>) relative to the sensing portion <b>102</b>, the sensed portion <b>104</b> is at a first distance D<b>1</b> relative to the sensing portion <b>102</b>, with the second polar end P<b>2</b> being closer to the sensing portion <b>102</b> than the first polar end P<b>1</b>. When the sensed portion <b>104</b> is at the second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>6</b></figref>) relative to the sensing portion <b>102</b>, the sensed portion <b>104</b> is at a second distance D<b>2</b> relative to the sensing portion <b>102</b>, with the first polar end P<b>1</b> being closer to the sensing portion <b>102</b> than the second polar end P<b>2</b>. The sensing portion <b>102</b> generates data correlating a first output voltage to the strength of the magnetic field of the second polar end P<b>2</b> sensed at the first distance D<b>1</b> and a second output voltage to the strength of the magnetic field of the first polar end P<b>1</b> sensed at the second distance D<b>2</b>, with the first output voltage being different from the second output voltage. As such, the first output voltage may be associated with the predetermined, non-tripped position of the shank <b>50</b>, and the second output voltage may be associated with the tripped position of the shank <b>50</b>. Each rotational position of the shank <b>50</b> between the non-tripped and tripped positions may correspond to a different compression distance of the biasing element <b>74</b>, and thus, a different output voltage between the first and second output voltages.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It should be appreciated that, while the sensing portion <b>102</b> is not shown as being received within the biasing element when the shank <b>50</b> is at least in the tripped position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>4</b> and <b>6</b></figref>), the sensing portion <b>102</b> may instead be positioned such that it is received within the biasing element <b>74</b> for any rotational position of the shank <b>50</b> about the first joint <b>66</b>. It should further be appreciated, that the Hall-effect sensing portion <b>102</b> may alternatively be configured as a unipolar Hall-effect sensor positioned such that the sensed portion <b>104</b> is at a different distance from the sensing portion <b>102</b> for each position between the non-tripped and tripped positions. Additionally, it should be appreciated that the sensing portion <b>102</b> may instead be configured as a linear potentiometer, with the sensed portion <b>104</b> being an arm coupled between a slider of the potentiometer and the cap <b>75</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the system <b>200</b> may include a computing system <b>202</b> and various other components configured to be communicatively coupled to and/or controlled by the computing system <b>202</b>.

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In general, the computing system <b>202</b> may comprise any suitable processor-based device known in the art, such as a computing device or any suitable combination of computing devices. Thus, in several embodiments, the computing system <b>202</b> may include one or more processor(s) <b>204</b>, and associated memory device(s) <b>206</b> configured to perform a variety of computer-implemented functions. As used herein, the term &#x201c;processor&#x201d; refers not only to integrated circuits referred to in the art as being included in a computer, but also refers to a controller, a microcontroller, a microcomputer, a programmable logic circuit (PLC), an application specific integrated circuit, and other programmable circuits. Additionally, the memory device(s) <b>206</b> of the computing system <b>202</b> may generally comprise memory element(s) including, but not limited to, a computer readable medium (e.g., random access memory RAM)), a computer readable non-volatile medium (e.g., a flash memory), a floppy disk, a compact disk-read only memory (CD-ROM), a magneto-optical disk (MOD), a digital versatile disk (DVD) and/or other suitable memory elements.

In addition, the computing system <b>202</b> may also include various other suitable components, such as a communications circuit or module, one or more input/output channels, a data/control bus and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It should be appreciated that, in several embodiments, the computing system <b>202</b> may correspond to an existing computing system of the agricultural implement <b>10</b> and/or of the work vehicle <b>12</b> to which the implement <b>10</b> is coupled. However, it should be appreciated that, in other embodiments, the computing system <b>202</b> may instead correspond to a separate processing device. For instance, in one embodiment, the computing system <b>202</b> may form all or part of a separate plug-in module that may be installed within the agricultural implement <b>10</b> to allow for the disclosed system and method to be implemented without requiring additional software to be uploaded onto existing control devices of the agricultural implement <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In some embodiments, the computing system <b>202</b> may be configured to include one or more communications modules or interfaces <b>208</b> for the computing system <b>202</b> to communicate with any of the various system components described herein. For instance, one or more communicative links or interfaces (e.g., one or more data buses) may be provided between the communications interface <b>208</b> and the trip sensor(s) <b>100</b> to allow the computing system <b>202</b> to receive data indicative of a magnitude of rotation of the shank <b>50</b> about the first joint <b>66</b> from the trip sensor(s) <b>100</b>. Further, one or more communicative links or interfaces (e.g., one or more data buses) may be provided between the communications interface <b>208</b> and one or more user interfaces (e.g., user interface(s) <b>150</b>) to allow operator inputs to be received by the computing system <b>202</b> and/or allow the computing system <b>202</b> to control the operation of one or more components of the user interface(s) <b>150</b>. Moreover, one or more communicative links or interfaces (e.g., one or more data buses) may be provided between the communications interface <b>208</b> and the positioning sensors (e.g., positioning sensor(s) <b>152</b>) to allow location data associated with the specific location at which such data was collected to be received by the computing system <b>202</b>. Additionally, one or more communicative links or interfaces (e.g., one or more data buses) may be provided between the communications interface <b>208</b> and the drive system (e.g., the engine <b>24</b> and/or the transmission <b>26</b>) of the work vehicle <b>12</b> to allow the computing system <b>202</b> to control the operation of one or more components of the drive system <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As indicated above, the computing system <b>202</b> may be configured to determine a magnitude of rotation of the shank <b>50</b> about the first joint <b>66</b> based at least in part on data indicative of the magnitude of rotation of the shank <b>50</b> (e.g., output voltage(s)) generated by the trip sensor(s) <b>100</b>. For example, the computing system <b>202</b> may include one or more suitable relationships and/or algorithms stored within its memory <b>206</b> that, when executed by the processor <b>204</b>, allow the computing system <b>202</b> to determine the magnitude of rotation of the shank <b>50</b>. For instance, when the trip sensor(s) <b>100</b> are configured to generate an output voltage based at least in part on the position of the sensed portion <b>104</b> of the trip sensor <b>100</b> relative to the sensing portion <b>102</b>, the computing system <b>202</b> may include pre-defined relationships or algorithms used to determine a corresponding rotational position of the shank <b>50</b> about the first joint <b>66</b> and/or associated depth of the shank <b>50</b>. Additionally, or alternatively, a look-up table may be generated by or provided to the computing system <b>202</b> that correlates output voltages from the trip sensor(s) <b>100</b> to the corresponding rotational position and/or associated depth of the shank <b>50</b>. Such look-up table may be generated, for example, by directly measuring the output voltages in response to known positions of the shank <b>50</b> and associated depths for a given position of the implement frame <b>28</b> during a testing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Based at least in part on the magnitude of each trip, the computing system <b>202</b> may be further configured to determine a trip event type. For instance, based on the magnitude and duration of each trip, the cause for the trip may be determined. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref> illustrates a graphical view of an example dataset <b>250</b> charting the position (rotation or depth) of a ground engaging tool (e.g., the shank <b>50</b>) over time in accordance with aspects of the present subject matter. During a first time period <b>252</b> between time t<b>0</b> and time t<b>1</b>, the shank <b>50</b> moves from the predetermined ground-engaging tool position p<b>0</b> toward the tripped rotational position p<b>2</b> to a position above a threshold position p<b>1</b> associated with the shank <b>50</b> rotating about the first joint <b>66</b> by a rotation greater than a magnitude threshold (or a depth less than a depth threshold). The first time period <b>252</b> is shorter than a predetermined time threshold, thus, the event during the first time period <b>252</b> represents a large trip event of the shank <b>50</b>, such as when a rock or other impediment is encountered. Similarly, during a second time period <b>254</b> between time t<b>2</b> and time t<b>3</b>, the shank <b>50</b> moves from the predetermined ground-engaging tool position p<b>0</b> toward the tripped rotational position p<b>2</b> to a position above the threshold rotational position p<b>1</b>. However, the second time period <b>254</b> is longer than the predetermined time threshold, thus, the event during the second time period <b>254</b> represents a float event. During a third time period <b>256</b> between time t<b>4</b> and time t<b>5</b>, a sequential series of rotations of the shank <b>50</b> from the predetermined ground-engaging tool position p<b>0</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>) to a position above the threshold rotational position p<b>1</b> occur. The average time for each rotation of the sequential series during third time period <b>256</b> is less than the predetermined time threshold, thus, the event during the third time period <b>256</b> represents a bad point.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>8</b></figref>, the computing system <b>202</b> may be further configured to perform a control action based at least in part on the trip magnitude and/or type of trip event. For instance, when the trip event is a normal trip event, such as shown during the first time period <b>252</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>), the computing system <b>202</b> may control an operation of the user interface <b>150</b> to indicate the impediment or normal trip event to an operator of the implement <b>10</b>. When the trip event is a float event, such as shown during the second time period <b>254</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>9</b></figref>), the computing system <b>202</b> may control an operation of the user interface <b>150</b> to indicate or display the float event and/or to request that a ground speed of the implement <b>10</b> and/or the work vehicle <b>12</b> be reduced. In some instances, the computing system <b>202</b> may automatically control one or more components of the drive system (e.g., the engine <b>24</b>, the transmission <b>26</b>, and/or the like) of the work vehicle <b>12</b> to reduce the ground speed of the implement <b>10</b> in response to the float event. When a bad point on the shank <b>50</b> is determined, the computing system <b>202</b> may control an operation of the user interface <b>150</b> to indicate the bad point and/or request that the point be replaced. It should be appreciated that, while not shown, if the shank <b>50</b> is not rotated by a magnitude greater than the magnitude threshold or raised to a position above the position associated with the rotation magnitude threshold, the trip may be noted as a minor trip event.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the computing system <b>202</b> may be configured to generate a map correlating a location within a field for each trip of the shank <b>50</b>. For example, the data generated by the trip sensor <b>100</b> may be geo-referenced or may otherwise be stored with corresponding location data received from the positioning sensor(s) <b>152</b>, which may include a Global Positioning System (GPS) or another similar positioning device(s), configured to transmit a location corresponding to a position of the implement <b>10</b> within the field when the data is generated by the trip sensor(s) <b>100</b>. For instance, the computing system <b>202</b> may generate a map (e.g. a heat map) correlating a location within a field to at least one of the magnitude of the rotation of the shank <b>50</b> or a depth of the shank <b>50</b> associated with the magnitude of the rotation based at least in part on the data generated by the trip sensor <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the map may indicate each trip event type and the corresponding location. In one embodiment, the computing system <b>202</b> may be further configured to control an operation of the user interface(s) <b>150</b> to display the map. The displayed map may be used to determine where rocks or other impediments need to be removed from the field, areas of the field that may need to be reworked, and/or the like.</p>
