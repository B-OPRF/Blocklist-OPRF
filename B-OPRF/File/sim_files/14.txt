<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention pertains to agricultural tillage implements and, more specifically, to a rear stabilization jack for an agricultural tillage implement.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Farmers utilize a wide variety of tillage systems to prepare soil for planting. For example, a strip tillage implement is capable of tilling soil in strips along the intended planting rows, moving residue to the areas in between rows, and preparing the seedbed of the strip in preparation for planting. As another example, a field cultivator is capable of simultaneously tilling soil and leveling the tilled soil in preparation for planting.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A tillage implement typically includes a frame that carries a number of cultivator shanks which can carry various tools for engaging the soil. The tools may include shovels, knives, points, sweeps, coulters, spikes, or plows. Each tool performs a function intended to ultimately convert compacted soil into a level seedbed with a consistent depth for providing desirable conditions for planting crops. A tillage implement may additionally include, or be connected with, other devices for inserting fertilizer following the passage of the cultivator shanks, closing the furrow created by the cultivator shanks, or breaking up the clods to create the uniform seedbed. For example, the tillage implement may be connected to an air cart which carries and injects fertilizer into the field.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Some tillage implements may additionally include one or more rear jacks to provide additional support to stabilize the implement when the implement is disconnected from the towing vehicle. For example, an implement that has heavy attachments or harrows at the rear of its frame may require a rear jack to balance the implement in order to keep the front hitch on the ground. Generally, to use the rear jack, the operator must climb on top of the implement and over the rear attachments to manually operate the rear jack. Once in position, the operator may need to rotate the rear jack from its storage position to its operating, support position. Then, the operator may be required to crank the rear jack to extend its length to achieve a desired support position. Thereafter, the operator may climb off of the implement to subsequently perform various other tasks. As can be appreciated, such known rear jacks can be difficult and cumbersome to operate. Additionally, rear jacks may become damaged if they are unknowingly left in their operating, support position. For instance, the operator may attach the implement and forget to position the rear jack in its storage position. Thereafter, the operator may move the implement, which then causes the rear jack to forcibly contact the ground, damaging the rear jack. Once broken, the rear jack must be repaired or replaced, otherwise the broken rear jack may improperly support the implement which may cause the implement itself to become damaged. Thereby, rear jacks can be tiresome to operate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">What is needed in the art is a cost-effective and automatic stabilization system for an agricultural tillage implement.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one exemplary embodiment formed in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a stabilization system for an agricultural implement. The stabilization system includes a rear stabilizer connected to the rear portion of the frame of the agricultural implement and a remote switch that is distally located away from the stabilizer on the front portion of the frame. The stabilizer is selectively extendable in between a retracted position and an extended, support position wherein the stabilizer engages with the ground for supporting the rear portion and leveling the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another exemplary embodiment formed in accordance with the present invention, there is provided an agricultural implement towable by an agricultural vehicle. The agricultural implement includes a frame with a front portion and a rear portion. The front portion has a hitch configured for removably connecting to the agricultural vehicle. The agricultural vehicle also includes a plurality of ground engaging tools connected to the rear portion and a stabilization system. The stabilization system includes at least one stabilizer connected to the rear portion. The at least one stabilizer is remotely operated for selectively supporting the rear portion relative to the front portion and leveling the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet another exemplary embodiment formed in accordance with the present invention, there is provided an agricultural vehicle that includes a chassis, a controller, and an agricultural implement. The agricultural implement includes a frame with a front portion and a rear portion. The front portion has a hitch removably connected to the chassis. The agricultural vehicle also includes a plurality of ground engaging tools connected to the rear portion and a stabilization system. The stabilization system includes at least one stabilizer connected to the rear portion. The at least one stabilizer is remotely operated for selectively supporting the rear portion relative to the front portion and leveling the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another exemplary embodiment formed in accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method for stabilizing agricultural equipment. The method includes an initial step of providing an agricultural implement that is towable by an agricultural vehicle. The agricultural implement includes a frame with a front portion and a rear portion. The front portion has a hitch configured for removably connecting to the agricultural vehicle. The agricultural vehicle also includes a plurality of ground engaging tools connected to the rear portion and a stabilization system. The stabilization system includes a remote switch and at least one stabilizer connected to the rear portion and operably connected to the remote switch. The at least one stabilizer is remotely operated for selectively supporting the rear portion relative to the front portion and leveling the frame. The method also includes extending the at least one stabilizer, by toggling the remote switch, to be in an extended support position wherein the at least one stabilizer contacts a ground surface for supporting a weight of the rear portion, and retracting the at least one stabilizer, by toggling the remote switch, to be in a retracted storage position wherein the at least one stabilizer does not contact the ground surface.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">One possible advantage of the exemplary embodiment of the agricultural implement is that the rear stabilizer may be actuated remotely, i.e., at a distance away from the stabilizer, so that the operator may selectively support and level the frame of the agricultural implement without needing to climb on top of the frame to actuate the stabilizer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another possible advantage of the exemplary embodiment of the agricultural implement is that the stabilizer may be automatically lifted into its retracted position so that the operator need not worry about manually retracting the stabilizer or forgetting about the stabilizer and subsequently damaging the stabilizer and/or the agricultural implement upon moving the agricultural implement.</p>

The terms &#x201c;longitudinal&#x201d; and &#x201c;transverse&#x201d; are determined with reference to the fore-and-aft direction of the agricultural tillage implement and are equally not to be construed as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b>-<b>3</b></figref>, there is shown an agricultural vehicle <b>10</b> in phantom. The agricultural vehicle <b>10</b> generally includes a chassis, a prime mover, wheels supporting the chassis, a controller <b>12</b> with a memory <b>14</b>, and an agricultural implement <b>16</b> removably connected to the chassis. The controller <b>12</b> may be in the form of a depth control system. The agricultural vehicle <b>10</b> may be in the form of any desired vehicle, such as a tractor.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The agricultural implement <b>16</b> may be in the form of any desired implement, such as a field cultivator. The agricultural implement <b>16</b> generally includes a frame <b>18</b>, wheels <b>20</b> supporting the frame <b>18</b>, multiple ground engaging tools <b>22</b>, and a stabilization system <b>24</b> for stabilizing, e.g. leveling or balancing, the frame <b>18</b>. For example, the stabilization system <b>24</b> may balance the frame <b>18</b> when the agricultural implement <b>16</b> is not connected to the agricultural vehicle <b>10</b> and/or when the agricultural implement <b>16</b> is connected to the agricultural vehicle <b>10</b> but the agricultural vehicle <b>10</b> and implement <b>16</b> are not presently in motion, i.e., stationary.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The frame <b>18</b> includes a front portion <b>26</b> and a rear portion <b>28</b>. The front portion <b>26</b> may include a hitch <b>30</b> that removably connects to the chassis of the agricultural vehicle <b>10</b>. The front and rear portions <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> may support any desired tool for fertilizing and/or working the field. The front portion <b>26</b> may refer to a section of the frame <b>18</b> that is in front of the center of mass of the frame <b>18</b>, and the rear portion <b>28</b> may refer to a section of the frame <b>18</b> that is behind of the center of mass of the frame <b>18</b>. As can be appreciated, the front and rear portions <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> may or may not correspond to a physical separation or structural divide within the frame <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The ground engaging tools <b>22</b> are connected to the frame <b>18</b>. For example, one or more ground engaging tools <b>22</b> may be connected to the rear portion <b>28</b> of the frame <b>18</b>, which may accordingly imbalance the frame <b>18</b> such that when the agricultural implement <b>16</b> is unhitched from the agricultural vehicle <b>10</b> the front portion <b>26</b> of the frame <b>18</b>, and the hitch <b>30</b> therewith, may upwardly tilt. Accordingly, when the front portion <b>26</b> of the frame <b>18</b> is upwardly tilted, the ground engaging tools <b>22</b> at the rear portion <b>28</b> of the frame <b>18</b> may undesirably contact the ground. As shown, the ground engaging tools <b>22</b> comprise shanks and roller baskets; however, the ground engaging tools <b>22</b> may comprise any desired tool.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The stabilization system <b>24</b> includes at least one stabilizer <b>32</b> located at the rear portion <b>28</b> of the frame <b>18</b> and a remote switch <b>34</b> located at the front portion <b>26</b> of the frame <b>18</b> for remotely operating each stabilizer <b>32</b>. Each stabilizer <b>32</b> selectively supports the rear portion <b>28</b> relative to the front portion <b>26</b> such that the frame <b>18</b> remains substantially level, i.e., horizontal, when it is unhitched from the agricultural vehicle <b>10</b>. For example, each stabilizer <b>32</b> may be extendable in between a retracted storage position and an extended support position wherein the stabilizer <b>32</b> contacts the surface of the ground for supporting the weight of the rear portion <b>28</b> relative to the front portion <b>26</b> so that the ground engaging tools <b>22</b> at the rear portion <b>28</b> do not contact the surface of the ground. Thereby, since each stabilizer <b>32</b> is remotely operated, the operator does not need to climb on top of the frame <b>18</b> or come within arms-reach of the stabilizer <b>32</b> in order to actuate the stabilizer <b>32</b>. Furthermore, the operator does not need to apply weights to the front portion <b>26</b> in order to keep the frame <b>18</b> level. As shown, the agricultural implement <b>16</b> includes only one stabilizer <b>32</b>; however, the agricultural implement <b>16</b> may include two, three, or more stabilizers.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The stabilizer <b>32</b> is also operably connected to the remote switch <b>34</b> via a wired or wireless connection. Additionally or alternatively, the stabilizer <b>32</b> may be operably connected to the controller <b>12</b> via a wired or wireless connection. Hence, the stabilizer <b>32</b> may only be operably connected to the switch <b>34</b> or dually operably connected to the switch <b>34</b> and the controller <b>12</b>. Thereby, the operator may manually control the operation of the stabilizer <b>32</b> via the switch <b>34</b> at the front portion <b>26</b> of the frame <b>18</b> or from within the cab of the agricultural vehicle <b>10</b> via inputting a user command into a user interface, such as a soil command screen of the controller <b>12</b>. Furthermore, the controller <b>12</b> may automatically extend or retract the stabilizer <b>32</b> upon the operator unhitching the agricultural implement <b>16</b> and/or towing the agricultural implement <b>16</b>. For example, the controller <b>12</b> may automatically retract the stabilizer <b>32</b> into its retracted position upon receiving a drive signal or speed signal from a corresponding sensor <b>36</b>, such as a shift-selection sensor or speed sensor, of the agricultural vehicle <b>10</b>. The sensor <b>36</b> may indicate that the agricultural vehicle <b>10</b> is moving or is about to move so that the stabilizer <b>32</b> is not damaged by a subsequent movement of the agricultural implement <b>16</b>. The stabilizer <b>32</b> is also rigidly connected to the rear portion <b>28</b> of the frame <b>18</b>. For example, the stabilizer <b>32</b> is rigidly connected to the rear portion <b>28</b> by at least one bracket <b>38</b>. In other words, the stabilizer <b>32</b> may be affixed to the rear portion <b>28</b> such that the stabilizer <b>32</b> cannot pivot but is allowed to extend and retract. Each bracket <b>38</b> may include a flat a plate <b>40</b> that is coupled to the rear portion <b>28</b> of the frame <b>18</b> via welding and/or one or more fasteners <b>42</b>, such as threaded U-bolts <b>42</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The plate <b>40</b> has a first end connected to the rear portion <b>28</b> and a second end with a receiving hole (unnumbered) therein for receiving and securing at least a portion of the stabilizer <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each stabilizer <b>32</b> may be in the form of a jack <b>32</b>, such as an electromechanical or hydromechanical jack. For example, the jack <b>32</b> may comprise a hydraulic cylinder, a valve block, and a solenoid valve with a dedicated control circuit on the valve block. Additionally, for example, the jack <b>32</b> may comprise an electric cylinder with an electric motor coupled thereto. The electrical wiring of such an electromechanical jack <b>32</b> may be integrated into the existing wiring hardware of the agricultural implement <b>16</b>, such as the existing 7-pin lighting wiring harness. For example, the jack <b>32</b> may have a 3-wire electrical power wiring with a ground wire, one wire for retracting the jack <b>32</b>, and another wire for extending the jack <b>32</b>. However, as can be appreciated, the jack <b>32</b> may have any desired electrical wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The switch <b>34</b> is connected to the front portion <b>26</b> of the frame <b>18</b>. More particularly, the switch <b>34</b> can be located at the hose boom of the hitch <b>30</b>. The switch <b>34</b> may comprise a single toggle switch <b>34</b> that can be toggled up or down for retracting or extending the stabilizer <b>32</b>. Alternatively, the switch <b>34</b> can include any desired switch(es), button(s), and/or lever(s). Furthermore, the switch <b>34</b> can include an electronic user interface. As discussed above, the operator may manually switch the switch <b>34</b> in order to extend or retract the stabilizer <b>32</b>. If the stabilizer <b>32</b> is dually connected to the to the switch <b>34</b> and the controller <b>12</b>, then the switch <b>34</b> may function as a manual override for the controller <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>, there is shown a method <b>50</b> for stabilizing agricultural equipment. By way of example only, the method <b>50</b> will be described with reference to the agricultural implement <b>16</b> as described above. The method <b>50</b> may include an initial step of providing agricultural equipment which should remain constantly level. For example, the method <b>50</b> may include a step of providing the agricultural vehicle <b>16</b> with the stabilization system <b>24</b>, as discussed above (at block <b>52</b>). The method <b>50</b> may include a step of extending the stabilizer <b>32</b>, by the operator manually toggling the remote switch <b>34</b>, to be in the extended support position for supporting and leveling the frame <b>18</b> of the agricultural implement <b>16</b> (at block <b>54</b>). Thereafter or concurrently therewith, the operator may disconnect the agricultural implement <b>16</b> from the agricultural vehicle<b>10</b> (at block <b>56</b>). It should be appreciated that the controller <b>12</b> may automatically extend the stabilizer <b>32</b> upon the operator disconnecting the agricultural implement <b>16</b> from the vehicle <b>10</b>. Thereby, the operator may temporarily store the agricultural implement <b>16</b> on its own without needing to counterbalance the hitch <b>30</b>. As desired, the operator may (re)connect the agricultural implement <b>16</b> to the agricultural vehicle <b>10</b> (at block <b>58</b>). Then, the method <b>50</b> may include a step of retracting the stabilizer <b>32</b>, by the operator manually toggling the remote switch <b>34</b>, to be in the retracted storage position (at block <b>60</b>). In this step, the controller <b>12</b> may also automatically retract the stabilizer <b>32</b> upon a movement of the agricultural implement <b>16</b>. In this regard, the stabilizer <b>30</b> may be actuated automatically by the controller <b>12</b> and/or manually by the operator from within or outside of the cab of the agricultural vehicle <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is to be understood that the steps of the method <b>50</b> can be performed by the operator and/or the controller <b>12</b> upon loading and executing software code or instructions which are tangibly stored on a tangible computer readable medium, such as on a magnetic medium, e.g., a computer hard drive, an optical medium, e.g., an optical disc, solid-state memory, e.g., flash memory, or other storage media known in the art.
