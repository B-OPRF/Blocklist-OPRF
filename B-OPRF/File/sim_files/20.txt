<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to finishing assemblies for agricultural implements.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is well known that to attain the best agricultural performance from a piece of land, a farmer must cultivate the soil, typically through a tillage operation. Common tillage operations include plowing, harrowing, and sub-soiling. Farmers perform these tillage operations by pulling a tillage implement behind an agricultural work vehicle, such as a tractor. Depending on the crop selection and the soil conditions, a farmer may need to perform several tillage operations at different times over a crop cycle to properly cultivate the land to suit the crop choice.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Modem farm practices demand a smooth, level field with small clods of soil in the fall and spring of the year. In this regard, residue must be cut, sized, and mixed with soil to encourage the residue to decompose and not build up following subsequent passes of machinery. To achieve such soil conditions, it is known to utilize rolling baskets, such as crumbler reels, to produce smaller, more uniform clod sizes and to aid in the mixing of residue. In some instances, pairs of rolling baskets or &#x201c;double-basket assemblies&#x201d; are rigidly coupled to a portion of the implement frame to condition the field during each pass. However, in such instances, uneven pressure may be applied to the baskets of each double-basket assembly. To prevent such uneven pressure, the rolling baskets of each double-basket assembly are fixed relative to each other by a hanger that is pivotably coupled to a portion of the implement such that the rolling baskets are configured to pivot together relative to the frame of the implement to follow the ground contour with more even pressure on each basket. However, since the double-basket assembly is allowed to freely pivot, a harmonic oscillation effect may occur, which undesirably causes a &#x201c;washboard&#x201d; or bumpy finishing of the field.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">One or more specific embodiments of the present disclosure will be described below. In an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments, all features of an actual implementation may not be described in the specification. It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">When introducing elements of various embodiments of the present disclosure, the articles &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; &#x201c;the,&#x201d; and &#x201c;said&#x201d; are intended to mean that there are one or more of the elements. The terms &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; &#x201c;including,&#x201d; and &#x201c;having&#x201d; are intended to be inclusive and mean that there may be additional elements other than the listed elements. Any examples of operating parameters and/or environmental conditions are not exclusive of other parameters/conditions of the disclosed embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present disclosure is generally directed to a hydraulic control of a finishing assembly (e.g., double-basket assembly) of an agricultural implement. In particular, a hydraulic actuator (e.g., hydraulic cylinder) acts as a damping element to minimize back-and-forth oscillations of the finishing assembly about a pivot point. Minimizing the oscillations enables the finishing assembly to be utilized to make a smooth, level field with small clods of soil. In addition, the hydraulic actuator is configured to selectively apply a bias force to one of the baskets of the double-basket assembly based on feedback from sensors disposed throughout the finishing assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring now to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of an embodiment of an agricultural implement <b>10</b>. In general, the implement <b>10</b> may be configured to be towed along a forward direction of travel <b>12</b> by a work vehicle (not shown), such as a tractor or other agricultural work vehicle. For example, the work vehicle may be coupled to the implement <b>10</b> via a hitch assembly <b>14</b> or using any other suitable attachments means. As shown, the hitch assembly <b>14</b> may be coupled to a frame <b>16</b> of the implement <b>10</b> to facilitate towing the implement <b>10</b> in the direction of travel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown, the frame <b>16</b> may extend in a longitudinal direction (e.g., as indicated by arrow <b>18</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) between a forward end <b>20</b> and an aft end <b>22</b>. The frame <b>16</b> may also extend in a lateral direction (e.g., as indicated by arrow <b>24</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) between a first side <b>26</b> and a second side <b>28</b>. In addition, the frame <b>16</b> may generally include a plurality of structural frame members <b>30</b>, such as beams, bars, and/or the like, configured to support or couple to a plurality of components.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In several embodiments, the frame <b>16</b> may include one or more sections. For example, as shown, in the illustrated embodiment, the frame <b>16</b> may include a main or center section <b>32</b> positioned centrally between the first and second sides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b> of the frame <b>16</b>. The frame <b>16</b> may also include a first wing section <b>34</b> positioned adjacent to the first side <b>26</b> of the frame <b>16</b>. Similarly, the frame <b>16</b> may also include a second wing section <b>36</b> positioned adjacent to the second side <b>28</b> of the frame <b>16</b>. The first and second wing sections <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> may be pivotably coupled to the main section <b>32</b> of the frame <b>16</b>. In this respect, the first and second wing sections <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> may be configured to fold up relative to the main section <b>32</b> to reduce the lateral width of the implement <b>10</b> to permit, for example, storage or transportation of the implement <b>10</b> on a road. However, in other embodiments, the frame <b>16</b> may include any suitable number of frame sections.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The implement <b>10</b> may further include various wheel assemblies coupled to the frame <b>16</b> to support the frame <b>16</b> relative to the ground and to facilitate towing the implement <b>10</b> in the direction of travel <b>12</b>. Specifically, in several embodiments, the implement <b>10</b> may include a plurality of center support wheel assemblies <b>42</b> located centrally on the frame <b>16</b> between its forward and aft ends <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, with the wheel assemblies <b>42</b> being spaced apart from one another in the lateral direction <b>24</b> of the implement <b>10</b> between its first and second sides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. In addition, the implement <b>10</b> may also include a plurality of forward support wheel assemblies <b>44</b> coupled to the frame <b>16</b> adjacent to the forward end <b>20</b> of the frame <b>16</b>, with the wheel assemblies <b>44</b> being spaced apart from one another in the lateral direction <b>24</b> of the implement <b>10</b> between its first and second sides <b>26</b>, <b>28</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the forward support wheel assemblies <b>44</b> may be spaced apart from the center support wheel assemblies <b>42</b> in the longitudinal direction <b>18</b> of the implement <b>10</b>. It should be appreciated that the implement <b>10</b> may include any suitable number and/or type of wheel assemblies in alternate embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, the implement <b>10</b> may also include a plurality of ground-engaging tools supported by the frame <b>16</b>. For example, in several embodiments, the frame <b>16</b> may be configured to support one or more gangs or sets <b>48</b> of disc blades <b>50</b> at its forward end <b>20</b>. In such embodiments, each disc blade <b>50</b> may, for example, include both a concave side (not shown) and a convex side (not shown). Furthermore, the gangs <b>48</b> of disc blades <b>50</b> may be oriented at an angle relative to the travel direction <b>12</b> to promote more effective tilling of the soil. Additionally, as shown, in one embodiment, the implement <b>10</b> may also include one or more finishing assemblies <b>10</b>, wherein the frame <b>16</b> may be configured to support the finishing assemblies <b>100</b> adjacent to its aft end <b>20</b>. As will be described below, each finishing assembly <b>100</b> may include a pair of rolling baskets <b>102</b>, which may, in turn, be configured to reduce the number of clods in the soil and/or firm the soil over which the implement <b>10</b> travels.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It should be appreciated that, in addition to the gangs <b>48</b> of disc blades <b>50</b> and the rolling baskets <b>102</b> of the finishing assemblies <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>1</b> and <b>2</b></figref> (or as an alternative thereto), the implement <b>10</b> may include any other suitable ground-engaging tools. For instance, if the implement <b>10</b> is configured as a cultivator or ripper, the implement <b>10</b> may include a plurality shanks, harrow tines, leveling blades, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should be appreciated that the configuration of the implement <b>10</b> described above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref> is provided only to place the present subject matter in an exemplary field of use. Thus, it should be appreciated that the present subject matter may be readily adaptable to any manner of implement configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b> and <b>3</b></figref>, various views of one embodiment of a finishing assembly (e.g., the finishing assemblies <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>) are illustrated in accordance with aspects of the present subject matter. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> illustrates a perspective view of one of the finishing assemblies <b>100</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref> illustrates a side view of a portion of the finishing assembly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>. It should be appreciated that, for purposes of discussion, the finishing assembly <b>100</b> will be generally described with reference to the tillage implement <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>1</b></figref>. However, those of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that the disclosed finishing assembly <b>100</b> may be utilized with any suitable agricultural implements having any other suitable implement configuration(s).</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In general, the finishing assembly <b>100</b> includes a pair of the rolling baskets <b>102</b>. For instance, as particularly shown in the illustrated embodiment, the finishing assembly <b>100</b> includes a first rolling basket <b>102</b>A and a second rolling basket <b>102</b>B.

In some embodiments the diameters D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b> of the rolling baskets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B are the same. Additionally, as shown in the illustrated embodiment, the rolling baskets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B are shown as having the same configuration, such as by being of the same basket type, i.e., single, formed bar basket type. However, in other embodiments, the diameters D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b> of the rolling baskets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, the basket type of the rolling baskets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B (e.g., a flat bar roller, or a round bar roller), or both the diameter D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b> and basket type may differ between the first and second rolling baskets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B. For instance, in one embodiment, the first rolling basket <b>102</b>A may have a smaller diameter than the second rolling basket <b>102</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in the illustrated embodiment, the finishing assembly <b>100</b> may further include a basket support assembly <b>104</b> configured to support the rolling baskets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B relative to each other. The basket support assembly <b>104</b> may generally include one or more hangers <b>106</b> configured to support the rolling baskets <b>102</b> for rotation relative to the ground, such as by including a hanger <b>106</b> at each of the opposed ends of the baskets <b>102</b>. For example, as shown in the illustrated embodiment, each hanger <b>106</b> has a forwardly extending arm <b>106</b>A relative to the direction of travel <b>12</b> of the implement <b>10</b>, and a rearwardly extending arm <b>106</b>B relative to the direction of travel <b>12</b> of the implement <b>10</b>. In such an embodiment, the forward-most basket (e.g., the first rolling basket <b>102</b>A) may be rotatably coupled to the forwardly extending arm <b>106</b>A of the hanger <b>106</b> by a first rotational coupling <b>108</b>A (e.g., a bearing(s) and associated mounting structure) such that the rolling basket <b>102</b>A is rotatable about a first rotational axis <b>110</b>A. Similarly, the rearward-most basket (e.g., the second rolling basket <b>102</b>B) may be rotatably coupled to the rearwardly extending arm <b>106</b>B of the hanger <b>106</b> by a second rotational coupling <b>108</b>B (e.g., a bearing(s) and associated mounting structure) such that the rolling basket <b>102</b>B is rotatable about a second rotational axis <b>110</b>B spaced apart from the first rotational axis <b>110</b>A along the direction of travel <b>12</b> of the implement <b>10</b>. Additionally, the forwardly and rearwardly extending arms <b>106</b>A, <b>106</b>B of the hanger <b>106</b> are fixed relative to each other such that the rolling baskets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B are supported in a fixed relationship relative to each other. More particularly, the rolling baskets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B are supported relative to each other via the hanger <b>106</b> such that the rotational axes <b>110</b>A, <b>110</b>B of the first and second rolling baskets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B are fixed relative to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In the illustrated embodiment, the basket support assembly <b>104</b> further includes a toolbar <b>112</b> configured to support one or more of the hangers <b>106</b>. More particularly, the toolbar <b>112</b> may be rigidly coupled to the hangers <b>106</b> of the rolling baskets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B to support each hanger <b>106</b> relative to the ground. For example, in the illustrated embodiment, the toolbar <b>112</b> extends along the lateral direction <b>24</b> and is received within or extends through an opening <b>114</b> defined by each of the hangers <b>106</b>. In such an embodiment, the toolbar <b>112</b> may be coupled to each hanger <b>106</b> at or adjacent to the location at which the toolbar <b>112</b> is received within or extends through the associated opening <b>114</b>. The toolbar <b>112</b> may, in some embodiments, support hangers <b>106</b> for more than one pair of rolling baskets <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Additionally, as shown in the illustrated embodiment, the basket support assembly <b>104</b> includes a pivot bracket <b>120</b> fixedly coupled to the toolbar <b>112</b>. For example, in some embodiments, the pivot bracket <b>120</b> is fixedly coupled to the toolbar <b>112</b> by one or more clamp bolts <b>122</b>, each of which is received around the toolbar <b>112</b> and fixed at its ends to the pivot bracket <b>120</b>. It should be appreciated, however, that in other embodiments, the pivot bracket <b>120</b> may be fixedly coupled to the toolbar <b>112</b> by any other suitable attachment means, such as by coupling the pivot bracket <b>120</b> to the toolbar <b>112</b> via welding.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Generally, the pivot bracket <b>120</b> may function to pivotably couple the basket support assembly <b>104</b> to a hydraulic actuator <b>121</b> (e.g., hydraulic cylinder) and a linkage <b>128</b> of the finishing assembly <b>100</b>. More particularly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, the linkage <b>128</b> extends lengthwise between a first end <b>124</b>A and a second end <b>124</b>B. The first end <b>124</b>A of the linkage <b>128</b> is pivotably coupled to the pivot bracket <b>120</b> of the basket support assembly <b>104</b> and the second end <b>124</b>B of the linkage <b>128</b> is pivotably coupled to a mounting bracket <b>126</b> of the finishing assembly <b>100</b>, with the mounting bracket <b>126</b> being fixedly coupled to a frame member <b>30</b> of the implement frame of the implement <b>10</b> (e.g., at the aft end of the implement <b>10</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The first end <b>124</b>A of the linkage <b>128</b> is pivotably coupled at the first end <b>124</b>A to the pivot bracket <b>120</b> at a pivot point <b>130</b>, which defines a pivot axis <b>130</b>A about which the basket support assembly <b>104</b> is configured to pivot relative to the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b> and the linkage <b>128</b>. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>3</b></figref>, the basket support assembly <b>104</b> is pivotable in a first pivot direction R<b>1</b> about the pivot axis <b>130</b>A and in a second pivot direction R<b>2</b> about the pivot axis <b>130</b>A, with the second pivot direction R<b>2</b> being opposite the first pivot direction R<b>1</b>. Additionally, as shown in the figures, given the configuration of the basket support assembly <b>104</b>, the pivot point <b>130</b> is positioned higher than the first and second rolling baskets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B in a vertical direction (e.g., as indicated by arrow <b>19</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>). The linkage <b>128</b> is further pivotably coupled at the second end <b>124</b>B to the mounting bracket <b>126</b> at a pivot point <b>132</b>. Similarly, a first end <b>127</b> of the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b> is pivotably coupled to the pivot bracket <b>120</b> at a pivot point <b>134</b>, which defines a pivot axis <b>142</b>. The pivot point <b>134</b> is positioned higher than the pivot point <b>130</b> in the vertical direction <b>19</b>, and opposite the toolbar <b>112</b>. It should be appreciated that the pivot point <b>134</b> may be vertically aligned with the pivot point <b>130</b> along the vertical direction <b>19</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, or may be offset from a vertical alignment with the pivot point <b>130</b>, such as in the direction of travel <b>12</b>. A second end <b>129</b> of the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b> is further pivotably coupled to the linkage <b>128</b> at a location <b>129</b> between the first end <b>124</b>A and the second end <b>124</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref>, a downforce actuator <b>138</b> (e.g., hydraulic cylinder) may be provided to supply downforce to the basket support assembly <b>104</b>. The downforce actuator <b>138</b> may generally be coupled between the mounting bracket <b>126</b> and the linkage <b>128</b> at the second end <b>124</b>B of the linkage <b>128</b>, such as at a location forward (e.g., relative to the frame member <b>30</b>) of the pivot point <b>132</b> defined between the linkage <b>128</b>A and the mounting bracket <b>126</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, as a rod <b>133</b> associated with downforce actuator <b>138</b> is extended, the linkage <b>128</b> pivots about the pivot point <b>132</b> in a first rotational direction <b>140</b>A, thereby raising the baskets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B relative to the ground. Conversely, as the rod <b>133</b> associated with the downforce actuator <b>138</b> is retracted, the first linkage <b>128</b>B pivots about the first pivot point <b>132</b> in a second rotational direction <b>140</b>B (opposite the first rotational direction <b>140</b>A), thereby lowering the baskets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B into contact with the ground to apply a desired downforce to the baskets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B (e.g., downward force D<sub>F </sub>and downward force D<sub>R </sub>to the forwards and rear baskets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B, respectively).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The linkage <b>128</b> is coupled to the pivot bracket <b>120</b> via a fastener <b>150</b> positioned at the pivot point <b>134</b>. The fastener <b>150</b> is configured to be pivotably received within the pivot bracket <b>120</b> such that the fastener <b>150</b> pivots about the pivot axis <b>142</b> relative to the pivot bracket <b>120</b>. The fastener <b>150</b> extends through an opening in the end <b>127</b> of the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In accordance with aspects of the present subject matter, to allow oscillations of the basket support assembly <b>104</b> to be at least partially damped or minimized during operation of the implement <b>10</b>, the finishing assembly <b>100</b> further includes at least one damping element, the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b>, provided in operative association with the basket support assembly <b>104</b>. More particularly, in several embodiments, the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b> is configured to damp pivoting of the basket support assembly <b>104</b> about the pivot point <b>130</b> in both the first pivot direction R<b>1</b> and the second pivot direction R<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">For example, when one of the baskets (e.g., the first basket <b>102</b>A) encounters rocks or other impediments in the field, the basket support assembly <b>104</b> is urged to pivot about the pivot axis <b>130</b>A in the second pivot direction R<b>2</b>. In such instance, the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b> may be configured to damp such pivotal motion. Similarly, when one of the baskets (e.g., the first basket <b>102</b>A) encounters a drop in the field, the basket support assembly <b>104</b> will tend to pivot about the pivot axis <b>130</b>A in the first pivot direction R<b>1</b>. In such instance, the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b> may be configured to damp such pivotal motion. As such, the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b> enables the rolling baskets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B to work the ground more evenly when encountering changes in the field and to experience less oscillation for a shorter amount of time, which results in a smoother field surface. Additionally, the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b> &#x201c;cushions&#x201d; the impact caused by larger impediments or divots, which may be used to protect various elements of the finishing assembly <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition, the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b> is configured to selectively apply a biasing force (as the operator desires) to either the rolling basket <b>102</b>A or the rolling basket <b>102</b>B (i.e., apply more or all biasing force to one of the two rolling baskets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B). As mentioned above, the downforce actuator <b>138</b> lowers the baskets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B into contact with the ground to apply a desired downforce (D<sub>F</sub>, D<sub>R</sub>) to the baskets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B. The hydraulic actuator <b>121</b> includes a base or piston <b>160</b> coupled to a rod <b>162</b>. The piston <b>160</b> moves a distance or length, L<sub>C</sub>, between a fully retracted position and an extended position due to pressures exerted on both sides of the piston <b>160</b> (e.g., pressure on rod side, P<sub>R</sub>, and pressure on the base or piston side, P<sub>B</sub>). The pressures P<sub>B </sub>and P<sub>R </sub>can be adjusted to provide a force bias to the forward basket <b>102</b>A and the rear basket <b>102</b>B and their associated downforces, D<sub>F </sub>and D<sub>R</sub>. For example, if P<sub>B </sub>is greater than P<sub>R</sub>, then a force bias is provided to the rear basket <b>102</b>B. If P<sub>R </sub>is greater than P<sub>B</sub>, then a force bias is provided to the forward basket <b>102</b>A. The force bias exerted by the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b> is balanced by a downforce pressure, P<sub>D</sub>, within the downforce actuator <b>138</b> via engagement of the baskets <b>102</b>A, <b>102</b>B with the ground. A piston <b>163</b> (e.g., coupled to the rod <b>133</b>) of the downforce actuator <b>138</b> moves a distance or length, L<sub>D</sub>, between a fully retracted position and an extended position to set the P<sub>D</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The force bias exerted by the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b> may be varied respect to L<sub>D </sub>or L<sub>C </sub>in conjunction with P<sub>D</sub>. In certain embodiments, the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b> is configured to selectively apply a biasing force to either the rolling basket <b>102</b>A or the rolling basket <b>102</b>B based on feedback received from sensors associated with (coupled to or disposed within components of the finishing assembly <b>100</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref> is a schematic view of an embodiment of the agricultural implement <b>10</b> having the finishing assembly <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>2</b></figref> coupled to a work vehicle <b>164</b> (e.g., tractor). The hydraulic actuator <b>121</b> includes one or more sensors <b>166</b> to detect parameters related to the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b>. For example, the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b> may include a position sensor (e.g., Hall-effect linear-displacement transducer, magnetostrictive transducer, etc.) to detect L<sub>C</sub>, which along with the geometry of the implement and the depth setting of the implement can be utilized to correlate the L<sub>C </sub>to tillage depth. The hydraulic actuator <b>121</b> may include one or more sensors to determine the pressure(s) (e.g., P<sub>R</sub>, P<sub>B</sub>) within the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b>. The hydraulic actuator <b>138</b> includes one or more pressure sensors <b>168</b> to detect parameters related to the downforce actuator <b>138</b>. For example, the downforce actuator <b>138</b> may include a position sensor (e.g., Hall-effect linear-displacement transducer, magnetostrictive transducer, etc.) to detect L<sub>D</sub>. The downforce actuator <b>138</b> may include a pressure sensor to determine P<sub>D</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The work vehicle <b>164</b> includes a controller <b>165</b> communicatively coupled to the sensors <b>166</b>, <b>168</b>. The controller <b>165</b> is configured to receive feedback from the sensors <b>166</b>, <b>168</b>. The feedback relates to a position (L<sub>C</sub>) of the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b>, a pressure differential (e.g., between P<sub>R </sub>and P<sub>B</sub>) across the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b>, a position (L<sub>D</sub>) of the downforce actuator <b>138</b>, and/or a pressure (P<sub>D</sub>) in the downforce actuator <b>138</b>. Based on this feedback, the controller <b>165</b> can control the positions of the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b> and the downforce actuator <b>138</b> (e.g. via actuators such as valve spools). By controlling the position of the hydraulic actuator <b>121</b> and/or the downforce actuator <b>138</b>, the controller <b>165</b> can control how much biasing force is selectively applied to each of the baskets. In addition, the controller <b>165</b> can control the downforce exerted on the baskets. The controller <b>165</b> is also coupled to an input device <b>170</b> (e.g., touchscreen, switch, button, joystick, keyboard, etc.) that enables the operator to provide an input to control the finishing assembly <b>100</b> (e.g., selecting a particular basket to apply a biasing force to).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The controller <b>165</b> may include a memory <b>172</b> and a processor <b>174</b>. In some embodiments, the processor <b>174</b> may include one or more general purpose processors, one or more application specific integrated circuits, one or more field programmable gate arrays, or the like. Additionally, the memory <b>172</b> may be any tangible, non-transitory, computer readable medium that is capable of storing instructions (e.g., related to applying biasing forces to the baskets based on sensor feedback, determining a position of a cylinder, determining a depth of the baskets, etc.) executable by the processor <b>174</b> and/or data that may be processed by the processor <b>174</b>. In other words, the memory <b>172</b> may include volatile memory, such as random access memory, or non-volatile memory, such as hard disk drives, read only memory, optical disks, flash memory, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref> is a flow chart of a method <b>176</b> for providing hydraulic control of a finishing assembly (e.g., finishing assembly <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. <b>2</b>-<b>4</b></figref>). One or more steps of the method <b>176</b> may be performed by a computing device (e.g., controller <b>165</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>4</b></figref>). One or more steps of the method <b>176</b> may be performed simultaneously or in a different order from that depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. <b>5</b></figref>. The method <b>176</b> includes receiving feedback from sensors coupled to components of the finishing assembly (block <b>178</b>). The sensors may be pressure sensors and/or positions sensors associated with a hydraulic actuator and/or downforce actuator of the finishing assembly as described above. The sensor feedback may include feedback related to a position of the hydraulic actuator, a pressure differential across the hydraulic actuator, a position of the downforce actuator, and/or a pressure in the downforce actuator. The method <b>176</b> may also include receiving an operator input (block <b>180</b>). The operator input may relate to applying a biasing force to a particular basket of a double-basket assembly. The method <b>176</b> includes actively adjusting (or applying) a biasing force to either rolling basket of the double-basket assembly (block <b>182</b>). Selectively adjusting or applying a biasing force to a particular basket of the double-basket assembly may include applying varying biasing force to one of the two rolling baskets. The selective application of a biasing force may be based solely on the received sensor feedback, solely based on the operator input, or a combination of the received sensor feedback and the operator input.</p>
